<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The period in French prison practice treated in
this volume is one of transition between the end of
the Old R&eacute;gime and the beginning of the New. It
presents first a view of the prisons of the period
immediately following the Revolution, and concludes
with the consideration of a great model penitentiary,
which may be said to be the “last word”
in the purely physical aspects of the whole question,
while its very perfection of structure and equipment
gives rise to important moral questions, which must
dominate the future of prison conduct.</p>

<p>Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century
the combat with the great army of depredators was
unceasingly waged by the champions of law and
order in France, to whom in the long run victory
chiefly inclined. As yet none of the new views held
by prison reformers in other countries had made
any progress in France. No ideas of combining
coercion with persuasion, of going beyond deterrence
by attempting reformation by exhortation; of
curing the wrong-doer and weaning him from his
evil practices, when once more sent out into the
world, obtained in French penology. At that earlier
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
date all the old methods, worked by the same
machinery, still prevailed and were, as ever, ineffective
in checking crime. An active, and for the
most part intelligent police was indefatigable in the
pursuit of offenders, who, when caught and sentenced
travelled the old beaten track, passing from
prison to prison, making long halts at the <i>bagnes</i>
and concluding their persistent trespasses upon the
guillotine, but that was all.</p>

<p>French prisons long lagged behind advanced practices
abroad, not only in respect of their structural
fitness and physical condition, but also in the measure
in which the method of conducting them effected
the morals of those who passed through them.
When the question was at last presented, it was considered
with the logical thoroughness and carried
out with the administrative efficiency characteristic
of the French government, when impressed with the
necessity for action in any given line.</p>

<p>The question for the French prison authorities&mdash;as
indeed it is the question of questions for the
prison government of all nations&mdash;is now: “What
can be and shall be done for the reform of the convict
rather than for his mere repression and punishment?”
The material aspects of the French prison
system have attained almost to perfection. These,
as well as the moral aspects of the subject, which
that very physical perfection inevitably presents, it
is the purpose of this volume to consider.

<p>The Revolution may be considered the dividing
line between the ancient and modern r&eacute;gime in
France. Many of the horrors of the first period,
however, survived far into the second, and although
with a more settled government the worst features
of the Terror disappeared, prisons remained in
character much the same. The Convention no doubt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
desired to avoid the evils of arbitrary imprisonment,
so long the custom with the long line of
despotic rulers of France, and would have established,
had it survived, a regular punitive system
by which prisons should serve for more than mere
detention and deprivation of liberty, intending them
for the infliction of penalties graduated to the nature
and extent of offences. It was decreed in 1791 that
the needs of justice should be supported by classifying
all prisons in four categories, namely: Houses
of detention for accused but untried prisoners;
penal prisons for convicted prisoners; correctional
prisons for less heinous offenders; houses of correction
for juveniles of fewer than sixteen years,
and for the detention of ill-conducted minors at the
request of their relatives and friends.</p>

<p>The scheme thus sketched out was excellent in
theory, but it was not adopted in practice until many
years later. France again came into the grip of a
despotism more grinding than any in previous days.
It was choked and strangled by an autocrat of unlimited
ambitions backed by splendid genius and an
unshakable will. Napoleon, even more than his
predecessors, needed prisons to support his authority,
and he filled them, in the good old-fashioned
way, with all who dared to question his judgment
or attack his power. He threw hundreds of State
prisoners into the criminal gaols, where they languished
side by side with the thieves and depredators
whose malpractices never slackened; and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
created or re-opened no less than eight civil prisons
on the line of the Bastile of infamous memory.
These were the old castles of Saumur, Ham, D’If,
Landskrown, Pierrech&acirc;tel, Forestelle, Campiano
and Vincennes. Here conspirators, avowed or suspected,
too outspoken journalists and writers with
independent opinions were lodged for indefinite
periods and often without process of law. It had
been taken as an accepted principle that the Emperor
of his own motion with no show of right, undeterred
and unchallenged, could at any moment
throw any one he pleased into prison and detain them
in custody as long as he pleased.</p>

<p>Such common gaols as still survived the shock
of the Revolution were pressed into service: Bic&ecirc;tre,
St. P&eacute;lagie, Saint Lazare, the Conciergerie and La
Force. The last named was of more recent date,
and really owed its existence to the mild-mannered
and unfortunate Louis XVI, who in 1780 desired to
construct a prison to separate the purely criminal
prisoners from those detained simply for debt. A
site was found where the rue St. Antoine ends
in the Marais. The ground had been bought thirty
years before for the erection of a military school,
but nothing had come of the project. New buildings
were erected upon the ground formerly occupied
by the gardens of the Ducs de la Force, as had been
done in the case of the Hotel St. Pol which had
belonged to Charles of Naples, brother of the king
known as St. Louis in French history. The new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
prison of La Force was to be established under good
auspices. It was to include rooms for habitation,
hospital, and yards for the separate exercise of various
classes of prisoners, the whole to cover a space
ten times as large as the For-l’&Eacute;v&ecirc;que and Petit
Ch&acirc;telet combined. It was to be interiorly divided
into five sections (afterwards increased to eight),
with names describing each section.</p>

<p>There was the “Milk Walk,” for those who had
failed to pay for the children they put out to nurse;
the “Debtors’ Side,” in the centre of the prison,
where non-criminals were lodged; the “Lions’
Pit,” described by a contemporary as the most horrible
place conceivable, where the worst classes of
criminals were herded together. Next came the
“Sainte Madeleine,” then the “Quarter of the
Ni&ocirc;mes,” after that the “Court of Fowls,” again the
“Court of Sainte Anne,” for old men and worn-out
vagabonds, and lastly, the “Court of Sainte Marie
of the Egyptians,” a hateful place, being a deep well
between high, damp walls which the sun’s rays never
reached, and in which were thrown prisoners whom
it was desired to isolate entirely. This prison of
La Force, from the first a very ruinous place, was
in use down to the middle of the nineteenth century
and received in its turn a large proportion of French
criminality, criminal convicts being confined with
political offenders and persons at variance with the
government of the hour. On the same register
might be read the names of Papavoine, the child
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
slayer, and the poet, B&eacute;ranger; Lacenaire, notorious
for his bloodthirsty murders, and Paul-Louis
Courier, the socialist.</p>

<p>An interesting contemporary account of La Force
and other prisons of Paris in Napoleonic days has
been preserved. M. Paul Corneille, Mayor of
Gournay-en-Bray, has published in the <i>Revue Penitentiaire</i>
the journal of his grandfather, who was an
involuntary guest of La Force. The r&eacute;gime in the
prison was abominable. Discipline was all a matter
of money. Such comfort as the prison afforded was
reserved for those only who could pay for it. There
were thirty-seven rooms in all. Thirty-four were
occupied by those who could pay the rent. The
remaining three were for the impecunious. In one
case forty-two individuals were crowded into nineteen
beds, and in another nineteen persons used
eleven beds. The ordinary bedding issued consisted
of a mattress, a woollen blanket and a counterpane.
A second mattress and sheets might be had for nine
francs a month. Prisoners on the “simple pistole”
were lodged in the back premises and excluded from
the first court. Prisoners on the “double pistole”
were somewhat better lodged and served. The
“pistole” was the name given to the mode of prison
life the prisoner was able to ensure himself by his
means, and was so called from the coin of that
name. Special small rooms were provided at exorbitant
rates; and the gaolers’ fees were considerable
from all sources, and, when the prison was full,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
enormous&mdash;each prisoner being good for at least
a dozen francs the month.</p>

<p>The prison rations were of the most meagre character.
A daily loaf of a pound and half of ammunition
bread and a spoonful of unpalatable soup would
barely have saved the prisoners from starvation, had
they not been permitted to buy extra articles at the
canteen. The insufficient nourishment and the unsanitary
conditions produced many deaths from disease.
An abb&eacute;, Binet by name, who had been imprisoned
for four years as a refractory priest, succumbed,
and another was driven by misery to poison
himself, which he did by soaking copper covered
with verdigris in a liquid, to which he added some
mercurial ointment, and then swallowed this disgusting
mixture. Prisoners were entirely at the
mercy of the gaolers, who had the monopoly of supplies
and charged exorbitant prices. Nothing could
be sold except at their shops, where a small fowl
cost five francs, three eggs, twelve sous, five small
potatoes, fifteen sous. It was the same with drink,
the prices of which were excessive and the fluid bad.
Many small devices were in force to increase the
gains of the gaolers, prisoners being allowed to pay
twenty sous for the privilege of sitting up two or
three hours later than the regular hour of closing.
With all this, the police were constantly in the
prisons, seeking information against suspected persons
or working up proofs to support a new trial.
The most rigorous rules existed as to letter writing;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
prisoners were allowed to write complaints to the
ministers and even to the Emperor himself, but their
correspondence passed through the gaoler’s hands
to the Prefecture of Police, where it was generally
lost.</p>

<p>The worst feature of La Force was that children
of tender years, often no more than seven years of
age, were committed to it for the most trifling misdeeds.
They were cruelly ill-used by the gaolers,
whip in hand, and they passed their time in idleness,
associating with the worst criminals with the result
that they grew up thoroughly corrupt.</p>

<p>We have a glimpse of La Force from the record
of the imprisonment of the poet, B&eacute;ranger. The
French governments after the Restoration continued
to be very sensitive, and frequently prosecuted their
critics, even versifiers of such genius as B&eacute;ranger.
They desired to make people good, religious and
submissive by law, and invoked it pitilessly against
the poet who dared to encourage free-thinking in
politics and religion. They were resolved to put
down what they deemed the abuse of letters, and
to punish not only the preaching of sedition but the
open expression of impiety. So, as the persecuted
said at the time, poetry was brought into court, and
songs, gay and light-hearted, written to amuse and
interest, were held to be mischievous, and their
writers were sent to prison. B&eacute;ranger was tried at
the assizes in 1822 for having exercised a pernicious
influence upon the people, and he was sentenced to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
three months’ imprisonment which he endured at
St. P&eacute;lagie. He was again arraigned in 1829 on
charges akin to the first, and now found himself
sentenced to La Force for nine months, and to pay
a fine of 10,000 francs, greatly to the indignation
of the general public. It was considered a shameful
perversion of the law to send the joyous singer to
herd with criminals, and he was visited by crowds
of right-thinking people from outside, eager to
show their sympathy. While in La Force, B&eacute;ranger
devoted himself to exposing some of the worst evils
of the r&eacute;gime, especially the improper treatment of
the juvenile offenders. On the day of his arrival,
when the gate was opened to admit him, he heard a
childish voice exclaim, “Look at the street; how
beautiful!” The view within must have been
dreary enough to force the contrast with that without&mdash;the
muddy, dirty side-street with its poor
shop-fronts and ugly, commonplace passers-by. He
was still more disgusted when they brought the
daily rations for these poor little ones: a coarse
vegetable soup in great tin cans, which was distributed
in rations to each child to be eaten anyhow,
without knife, fork or spoon, very much like dogs
from a trough. The poet made a vigorous protest
to the governor, adding that he wondered these
human beings were not obliged to walk like beasts
on all fours. The answer he got was that it would
cost money to supply utensils; whereupon B&eacute;ranger
took all the expense on himself. He was in fact
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
continually employed in charitable deeds. While in
prison he visited all parts of it: the various courts,
the “Milk Walk” the “Debtors’ Side” and the
“Lions’ Pit,” distributing food and small luxuries,
wine, tobacco and bread to the inmates. He listened
patiently to all complaints, the injustice of their
punishment being, as ever with prisoners, the chief
burden of their song. “I see how it is,” he once
replied, “the only guilty one here is myself.” But
he was always overwhelmed with grateful thanks,
and one inmate of the prison composed a poem in
his honor. When B&eacute;ranger received it, he was
eager to ascertain the name of his brother songster.
He learned that it was the work of Lacenaire, the
murderer, then awaiting sentence for his many
atrocious crimes.</p>

<p>Another literary prisoner was thrown into La
Force about the same time. This was A. Chenu,
who afterward published his experiences in a small
book entitled “Malefactors.” The first sight that
met his eyes on arrival, according to Coquers, was
the words, written large upon the wall, “Death to
tell-tales.” He was at once approached by the
provost, the prisoner who wielded supreme power in
the room and whose business it was to collect the
sums demanded from new arrivals, who promised
protection and help. The provost provided writing
materials and arranged the secret conveyance of letters
for prisoners, and when one of their frequent
quarrels broke out he settled the preliminaries of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
duel, which was the only possible end. They were
strange fights, as often as not conducted with one
knife, the only weapon to be obtained, which the
combatants used in turn, after drawing lots for the
first stab. Numerous wounds were frequently inflicted
on each side with fatal result before honor
was satisfied.</p>

<p>St. P&eacute;lagie was used as a prison pure and simple
during the revolutionary epoch and afterwards, like
La Force, received debtors, convicted prisoners and
prisoners of State. It was notorious in the Napoleonic
r&eacute;gime for having as governor one Wallerand,
who deserved to have been dismissed fifty
times over, and was finally proceeded against at law.
He had powerful protectors, having married into
the family of the Prefect of Police, and was greatly
feared for his vindictive temper, which never spared
any one who dared to protest against or to complain
of their treatment. This governor practised
all the exactions already described as prevailing at
La Force, and raised the charges of the “pistole”
till the prisoners were completely fleeced and ruined.</p>

<p>Instances of Wallerand’s barbarous treatment
may be quoted. A prisoner named Thomas was employed
by him as a groom, and escaped through an
unbarred window in the stable, but was recaptured.
Wallerand, furiously angry, threw him into a cell,
and ordered that he should be flogged three times a
day. Death would probably have been his portion,
had not two other prisoners informed an inspector
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
of police, who was visiting the prison and who saved
the victim from his keeper’s rage. Wallerand
avenged himself by lodging the two informers in the
cell just vacated. An ancient priest, after much
cruel suffering, fell ill and begged hard that he
might be attended by another doctor than the medical
attendant of the prison. Wallerand obstinately
refused to give his consent, and the old man died.
He got into trouble once by entertaining a great
party of some hundred and fifty friends in the
prison on his f&ecirc;te day. The largest hall in the
prison was splendidly decorated and lighted by five
hundred candles. The entertainment consisted of
the performance of an opera and a grand display of
fireworks in the prison court, a great ball and a
splendid supper. The police authorities, although
well disposed to Wallerand, could not tolerate this
impudence, and he was suspended for a time, but
received no other punishment.</p>

<p>Among the many foul prisons of the Capital
Bic&ecirc;tre was quite the worst of all, and it was
said of it that nowhere else could such horrors be
witnessed. At once a prison, a madhouse and
refuge for paupers, wretchedness and insanity existed
along with vice and crime. John Howard, the
English philanthropist, who visited it in 1775, draws
a terrible picture of it, which will best be realised by
transcribing his own words: “Bic&ecirc;tre is upon a
small eminence about two miles from Paris; if it
were only a prison, I should call it an enormous one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
But this for men, like the ‘Hopital General’ for
women, is indeed a kind of general hospital. Of
about four thousand men within its walls, not one-half
are prisoners. The majority are the poor, who
wear a coarse brown uniform, and seem as miserable
as the poor in some of our own country workhouses;
the insane; and men that have foul diseases. Each
sort is in a court and apartments totally separate
from the other and from criminals. These last are
confined, some in little rooms about eight feet
square, windows three and one-half feet by two, with
a grate, but not many glazed. By counting the windows
on one side of the house I reckoned there must
be five hundred of those rooms. There is but one
prisoner in each. These pay two hundred livres a
year for their board. There are others in two large
rooms called La Force, on the other side of the
courtyard, La Cour Royale, which are crowded with
prisoners. Over these two rooms is a general infirmary;
and over that an infirmary for the scurvy,
a distemper very common and fatal among them.</p>

<p>“In the middle of La Cour Royale are eight
dreadful dungeons down sixteen steps; each about
thirteen feet by nine, with two strong doors; three
chains fastened to the wall and a stone funnel, at
one corner of each cell, for air. From the situation
of these dreary caverns and the difficulty I found in
procuring admittance, I conclude hardly any other
stranger ever saw them. That is my reason, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
I hope will be my apology, for mentioning the particulars.</p>

<p>“Prisoners make straw boxes, toothpicks, etc.,
and sell them to visitants. I viewed the men with
some attention and observed in the looks of many
a settled melancholy; many others looked very
sickly. This prison seems not so well managed as
those in the city; it is very dirty; no fireplace in
any of the rooms, and in the severe cold last winter
several hundred perished.”</p>

<p>The condition of Bic&ecirc;tre during the Napoleonic
epoch was almost inconceivably bad. It was very
convenient for the officials of the Prefecture, who
committed to it almost every one who came into
their hands. Disastrous overcrowding was the
natural result. When so many were herded together
within its narrow limits, fevers and scurvy
were epidemic; diseases were particularly engendered
by the waters of the wells, which were charged
with deleterious constituents. All classes were associated
together pell-mell. Prisoners of State, of
good character and cleanly life, lived constantly
with the dregs of Paris society. The interior
r&eacute;gime was regulated upon the same lines as those
of the prisons already described. The same tyrannical
treatment prevailed, the same extortion, the
same lack of even the smallest physical comforts.
It might well be styled the new sewer of Paris, and
the word Bic&ecirc;tre was rightly adopted into the current
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
<i>argot</i> as a pseudonym for misery and misfortune.</p>

<p>In corroborative testimony of the horrors of Bic&ecirc;tre
I will quote here the description given of it by
another witness, who had personal experience of the
prison. We shall hear more of Vidocq on a later
page, the well-known ex-convict who turned thief
catcher and, in a measure, originated the French
detective police system.</p>

<p>“The prison of the Bic&ecirc;tre,” says Vidocq in his
“Memoirs,” “is a neat quadrangular building, enclosing
many other structures and many courts,
which have each a different name. There is the
<i>grand cour</i> (great court) where the prisoners walk;
the <i>cour de cuisine</i> (or kitchen court); the <i>cour des
chiens</i> (or dogs’ court); the <i>cour de correction</i> (or
the court of punishment) and the <i>cour des fers</i> (or
court of irons). In this last court is a new building
five stories high. Each story contains forty cells,
each capable of holding four prisoners. On the
platform, which takes the place of a roof, was night
and day a dog named Dragon, who for a time
passed in the prison for the most watchful and incorruptible
of its kind. Some prisoners managed,
at a subsequent period, to corrupt him through the
medium of a roasted leg of mutton, which he had
the culpable weakness to accept; so true is it that
there are no seductions more potent than those of
gluttony, since they operate indifferently on all organised
beings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>“Near by is the old building, arranged in nearly
the same way. Under this were dungeons of safety,
in which were enclosed the troublesome and condemned
prisoners. It was in one of these dungeons
that for forty-three years lived the accomplice of
Cartouche, who betrayed him to procure this commutation.
To obtain a moment’s sunshine he frequently
counterfeited death, and so well did he do
this that when he had actually breathed his last
sigh, two days passed before they took off his iron
collar. A third part of the building, called La
Force, comprised various rooms, in which were
placed prisoners who arrived from the provinces
and were destined like ourselves to the chain.</p>

<p>“At this period the prison of Bic&ecirc;tre, which is
only strong from the strict guard kept up there,
could accommodate twelve hundred prisoners; but
they were piled on each other, and the conduct of
the jailers in no way assuaged the discomforts of
the place. A sullen air, a rough tone and brutal
manners were exhibited to the prisoners, and
keepers were in no way to be softened but through
the medium of a bottle of wine or a pecuniary bribe.
Besides, they never attempted to repress any excess
or any crime; and provided that no one sought to
escape, one might do whatever one pleased in the
prison, without being restrained or prevented; whilst
men, condemned for those crimes which modesty
shrinks from naming, openly practised their detestable
libertinism, and robbers exercised their industry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
inside the prison without any person attempting to
check the crime or prevent the bestiality.</p>

<p>“If any man arrived from the country well clad
and condemned for a first offence, who was not as
yet initiated into the customs and usage of prisons,
in a twinkling he was stripped of his clothes, which
were sold in his presence to the highest bidder. If
he had jewels or money, they were alike confiscated
to the profit of the society, and if he were too long
in taking out his earrings, they were snatched out
without the sufferer daring to complain. He was
previously warned that if he spoke of it, they would
hang him in the night to the bars of his cell and
afterwards say that he had committed suicide. If
a prisoner, out of precaution when going to sleep,
placed his clothes under his head, they waited until
he was in his first sleep, and then tied to his foot a
stone, which they balanced at the side of his bed.
At the least motion the stone fell and, aroused by
the noise, the sleeper jumped up; and before he
could discover what had occurred, his packet,
hoisted by a cord, went through the iron bars to the
floor above. I have seen in the depths of winter
these poor devils, having been deprived of their property
in this way, remain in the court in their shirts
until some one threw them some rags to cover their
nakedness. As long as they remained at Bic&ecirc;tre,
by burying themselves, as we may say, in their
straw, they could defy the rigor of the weather, but
at the departure of the chain, when they had no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
other covering than frock and trousers made of
packing cloth, they often sank exhausted and frozen
before they reached the first halting place.”</p>

<p>The origin and early history of the Conciergerie
has been given in a previous volume, but its records
are not yet closed, for it still stands on the Island
of the City in close proximity to the Palace of Justice.
It has many painful memories associated with
its later history, and is more particularly notable
as having been the last place of durance of the unfortunate
Marie Antoinette. The cell she occupied
is still preserved and is decorated nowadays with
pictures and memorial inscriptions. Through all
the changes that have come over the old prison, the
cell in which the Queen of France awaited execution
has always been kept religiously intact, although
many right-thinking people are ashamed of
this hideous relic of an atrocious national crime.
The order for the Queen’s execution is still preserved
in the archives and runs as follows:&mdash;“On
the 25th day of the first month of the second year
of the French Republic one and indivisible, the
woman named Marie Antoinette, commonly called
of Lorraine and Austria, wife of Louis Capet, has
been removed from this house at the request of the
public accuser of the Revolutionary Tribune and
handed over to the executioner to be taken to the
Place de la Revolution there to suffer death.” The
fate that overtook her contrasts painfully with the
good intentions of the mild and humane Louis XVI,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
who soon after his accession sought to improve the
Conciergerie prison. “We have given all our care,”
he announced in a decree in 1780, “to mend the
prison, to build new and airy infirmaries and provide
for the sick prisoners.” A separate quarter was
provided for males and females, no one henceforth
was consigned to the underground dungeons, the
great central court was provided with a shelter
from rain, the interior was heated. But these reforms
were short-lived. At the outbreak of the
Revolution, the worst horrors were revived. An
account of the sufferings in this prison are given by
Baron Riouffe in his “Memoirs”: “I was thrown,”
says he, “into the deepest and foulest dungeon,
entirely deprived of light, the atmosphere poisonous,
and inconceivable dirtiness around. Seven of us
were crowded in this small space, some of them
robbers, one a convict condemned to death. We
were inspected daily by stalwart warders accompanied
by fierce dogs.” This description was confirmed
by the author of the “Almanac of Prisons”
during the period. The cells were never opened to
be brushed out, but occasionally they changed the
straw; yet an exorbitant sum was demanded for
rent, and it was often said that the Conciergerie was
the most profitable hotel in Paris having regard to
its charges.</p>

<div id="i_028" class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>The Conciergerie</i></p>

<p>The old prison of the Palais de Justice in Paris. When
the palace was inhabited by the kings of France, the name
“Conciergerie” was given to the part of the building containing
the home of the concierge.</p>

<img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Throughout the Napoleonic epoch the Conciergerie
was appropriated largely to political prisoners;
and at the Restoration it was the last resting-place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
of Marshal Ney, who left it only to be shot. Comte
de La Valette, who had been one of Napoleon’s
aides-de-camp, and who was arrested after Waterloo
on no other charge than that of loyalty to his old
master, was sent also to the Conciergerie, and detained
there under sentence of death. The story of
his escape, through the devotion of his wife and the
friendly assistance of three English gentlemen, two
of them officers of the army, is told in his own
“Memoirs.” When he was taken to the Conciergerie
he was lodged in the cell which had been occupied
by Marshal Ney, a long, narrow room, terminated
by a window with a shutter that made reading impossible
except for a short period on the brightest
days. He lay here for some weeks, sustaining himself
with the hope of escaping the scaffold, being
told that his punishment would be limited to a few
years of imprisonment. The cell he occupied was
just over the woman’s ward, and this neighborhood
irritated and annoyed him greatly; for all day long
he could hear their voices chattering continually
and using the most abominable language. The two
windows of the Queen’s prison had also looked
upon this courtyard, and she had been subjected to
the same annoyance. It was a dark den at the end
of a blind corridor, and during her occupancy had
held only a common bedstead, a table and two
chairs. The room was divided by a heavy porti&egrave;re,
and on the far side a gendarme and gaoler were
constantly on duty. When La Valette was most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
depressed he comforted himself by the thought that
he did not suffer as much as this high-born daughter
of a long line of emperors. Close alongside his
quarters was the condemned cell, but no one was
executed while he was there. One man, who had
murdered his wife under horrible circumstances,
seemed certain to lose his life; but the violent hysterics,
into which he fell on returning from court,
and which La Valette concluded were caused by his
sentence to death, were really the result of joy at
his acquittal.</p>

<p>La Valette was not entirely forbidden to see his
friends, and many came, bringing him consolation
and the more tangible benefits of louis d’or, which
came in most fortunately in his subsequent escape.
At last his trial came on, and although he was
admirably defended he was sentenced to death.
Passion still ran high, and it was impossible to extend
mercy to an ex-aide-de-camp of the fallen emperor.
Madame de La Valette pleaded hard for her
husband’s life, and she gained an audience with the
King himself. He briefly told her that he must do
his duty as he had already done it in executing
Marshal Ney. Madame de La Valette was one of
the Beauharnais family, the niece of the Empress
Josephine, who had been given to La Valette as his
bride by Napoleon himself. She was possessed
of great beauty and great strength of mind. After
sentence had been passed she was permitted to visit
her husband and to communicate to him the failure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of her intercession. When alone with him she
apprised him of the plan formed to compass his
escape. “I shall come to-morrow evening, bringing
with me some of my own clothes. You shall
wear them, and, mounting my sedan chair, shall
leave the prison in my place. You will be taken to
the rue des Saints P&egrave;res where M. Baudus will be in
waiting, and you will be conducted to a safe hiding-place,
where you will wait until the danger is over
and you can leave France.”</p>

<p>La Valette at first stoutly refused to accept this
proposal, which seemed to him far-fetched, and
threatened to expose Madame de La Valette to insult
and ill-usage when the escape was discovered.
A brief struggle between them ended in La Valette
at last giving his consent, and the details were arranged.
Next evening Madame de La Valette arrived
dressed in a long merino mantle lined with
fur, and in a small bag she carried a petticoat of
black taffeta. She was accompanied by their daughter,
a child of twelve or thirteen, and it was arranged
that at seven o’clock, La Valette, having
disguised himself, should walk out, taking his
young daughter by the hand and being careful to
conceal his face as he passed out. It would have
been safer to wear a veil, but Madame de La Valette
had never done so in her previous visits, and
it might cause suspicion. “Also,” she said, “be
particularly careful as you go out; any awkwardness
would betray you. The doors are very low,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
and you may catch the feathers of my bonnet. If
everything goes well, you will find the gatekeeper
will give you his hand politely and see you to the
sedan chair.” The child was to follow closely at
his heels, and to take her place on her father’s left,
so as to prevent the gatekeeper from giving his
arm to the fugitive, in which there was a possible
danger. After they had dined together, a small
family party, the disguise was put on. As La
Valette was about to make his attempt he begged
his wife to step behind a screen in the room, and
remain there as long as possible so as to postpone
discovery. “The gatekeeper always comes in
as soon as I ring a bell, giving him notice that I am
alone,” writes La Valette, “and if you will cough
and make a movement behind, showing some one is
there, he will wait patiently for a time. The longer
this detention the more time I shall have had to get
away.” La Valette then went out into the great
lodge, where half a dozen officials lounged idly or
were seated, watching the lady pass. The gatekeeper
only made the remark: “You are leaving
earlier than usual, Madame. It is a sad occasion.”
He thought she had taken a last farewell of her
husband, for the execution was fixed for the following
day. The disguised La Valette counterfeited
poignant grief extraordinarily well, with handkerchief
to eyes and heart-rending expressions of sorrow.</p>

<p>They reached the outer gate at length, where the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
last guardian sat, keys in hand, one for the iron
grating, the other for the wicket beyond, and La Valette
was soon outside but not yet free. The sedan
chair was there, but no chairmen, no servants. The
fugitive got inside under the sentry’s eyes, and
shrunk back behind the curtains to avoid observation,
but still a prey to the keenest anxiety and ready
for any desperate act. Two minutes passed, and
seemed a whole year. Then a voice cried, “The
fellow has disappeared, but I have got another
chairman,” and the sedan was now lifted from the
ground and carried across the street, to where a
carriage was in waiting on the Quai des Orfevr&eacute;s.
The transfer was quickly effected, the horses
whipped up and started at a rapid trot across the
Saint Michel Bridge, and so by the rue de la Harpe
to the rue Vaugirard behind the Od&eacute;on. La Valette
began at last to have hope of liberty, which grew
when he recognised in the coachman a devoted
friend, the Comte de Chasseuon, who spoke to him
encouragingly, saying there were pistols in the
carriage and that they must be used if required.
As the carriage drove on, La Valette exchanged
his woman’s clothes for a groom’s suit, and when
it stopped he jumped out at the bidding of his
friend, M. Baudus, who was to act as his new
master.</p>

<p>It was now eight in the evening, pitch dark and
the rain falling in torrents; the neighborhood was
deserted and silent save when the sound of galloping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
horses’ hoofs were heard, and several gensdarmes
passed at a hard gallop. No doubt the
escape had been discovered, and pursuit had begun.
La Valette, wearied and agitated, having lost one
shoe, walked on as best he could, through the mud,
following his master into the door of a house in the
rue de Grenelle, which was actually the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, and the residence of the Duc de
Richelieu. M. Baudus stopped to speak a few words
to the Swiss after bidding La Valette to run up-stairs.
“Who is that?” asked the Swiss. “My
servant,” replied M. Baudus, “going up to his own
room.” This was enough for La Valette, who
hastened to the third floor, where some one met
him, and without speaking led him into a room, the
door of which was immediately closed on him.
There was a stove alight, giving out heat and flame,
and La Valette, stretching out his hands to warm
them, touched a match box and a candle. He at
once accepted this as permission to light up. He
found himself in a good sized garret, furnished
comfortably with bed, chest of drawers and a table,
on which was a scrap of paper with a few words.
“Make no noise, only open the window at night
time, put on slippers and have patience.” On this
table was also a bottle of excellent Burgundy, several
books and a basket containing toilet appliances.
He had fallen among friends certainly, but why in
this house, under the same roof as a department
of State, presided over by a perfect stranger, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Duc de Richelieu? But M. Baudus was an employee
in the office, and he remembered perhaps
the Eastern proverb that “the thief in hiding is
safest under the walls of the King’s castle.” It
seemed, however, that a certain Madame Bresson,
whose husband was cashier in the Foreign Office,
had resolved to help the first fugitive seeking
safety, in gratitude for the escape of M. Bresson
on a previous occasion. The two were now moved
to pity and indignation at the ignoble spite vented
by the government, and their cruel treatment of
political enemies.</p>

<p>La Valette’s escape from the Conciergerie spread
fear and dismay among the adherents of Louis
XVIII. No one went to bed that night in the
Tuileries. Reports were circulated that a vast conspiracy
had been formed, and the escape was to be
a signal for the storm to burst. Some time elapsed
before the alarm was given from within the prison.
The warder attendant had entered the prisoner’s
room as usual, but, deceived by the noise made behind
the screen, had again withdrawn, to return five
minutes later and make closer investigation. He
saw Madame de La Valette standing there alone,
and the truth broke in upon him. He turned to run
out, but the devoted wife clung to him crying,
“Wait, wait, give my husband time, let him get
further away.” “Leave go, leave go,” he replied,
roughly shaking her off, “I am a lost man;” and
he rushed away shouting, “He is gone; the prisoner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
has escaped!” Dismay and confusion prevailed
on all sides. Gaolers, attendants and gensdarmes
ran here and there. One or two hurried
after the sedan chair, which was still in sight, jogging
along the quay, and fell upon it savagely. It
was empty, as we know, and his carriage had already
removed the fugitive to a distance.</p>

<p>A certain calm now fell upon the bewildered
keepers, and more systematic pursuit was organised.
Visits were forthwith paid to all La Valette’s friends
and acquaintances. Orders were issued to close and
watch the barriers, hand-bills were hastily printed,
giving particulars of the escape. For half an hour
Madame de La Valette was consumed with the liveliest
anxiety, but as her husband was not brought
back she was satisfied he had not been recaptured.
But her situation was painful in the extreme, for
the gaolers bitterly reproached her, using threats
and curses. Then a high official appeared upon the
scene, and, interrogating her rudely, upbraided her
angrily for the part she had played. She was
plainly told not to look for release and was committed
to a room, which she knew had been Marshal
Ney’s last resting-place, and was full of the saddest
memories. Directly under her windows was the
courtyard of the female prison, and she was within
earshot of the conversation of the lowest of her
own sex. There they kept her in the strictest seclusion,
her lady’s maid was not permitted to join her,
and she was waited upon by one of the female
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
gaolers. She was not allowed to write or receive
letters, or see visitors. Not a syllable of news
reached her, and she was left in such increasing
anxiety and agitation of mind that she did not
sleep for nearly three weeks. La Valette’s little
daughter had been received into a convent, where
she was not unkindly treated, although the mothers
of other inmates objected to their association with
the child of a condemned and prosecuted man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fugitive had found safety and
comparative comfort in the hands of his loyal and
devoted friend. He spent the first night at his
window, breathing the free air; then towards the
small hours slept the sleep of the just. When he
woke he found a servant sweeping out his room,
and was visited by his host, who assured him he had
nothing whatever to fear. Neither the threats
launched against those who gave him an asylum
nor the rewards promised to those who would betray
had the slightest weight with Madame Bresson,
who was prepared to watch over him with the most
scrupulous fidelity&mdash;so much so, that when he
asked for small beer to quench his incurable thirst,
he was refused. “We are not in the habit of drinking
beer here, and if it is ordered it may suggest
that we have some new lodger in the place.” M.
Bresson emphasised his caution by the story of a
M. de Saint Morin, who was betrayed and perished
on the scaffold during the Terror because he would
eat a fowl, the bones of which he picked and threw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
out of the window. They were seen by a neighbor,
who knew that the old woman who owned the
house could not afford to eat fowls, and it was concluded
that she was giving shelter to some one of
better class. This led to the discovery and arrest of
M. de Saint Morin. “No, no,” said M. Bresson,
“you can have as much drink as you please,&mdash;syrups
and <i>eau sucr&eacute;</i>&mdash;but no beer.”</p>

<p>The days passed, the excitement in Paris did not
diminish, the police were increasingly active, and it
became more and more necessary to smuggle La
Valette away. Various plans were suggested, one
that he should escape in the carriage of a Russian
general, who would pass the barrier, having La Valette
concealed in the bottom of the coach. A condition
was that the general’s debts to the amount
of 8,000 francs should be paid, and the money
would have been forthcoming, but he would not
move without knowing the name of the fugitive,
and this was deemed dangerous to divulge. Another
plan was that La Valette should march out
of Paris, incorporated with a Bavarian Battalion
on its way home. The officer in command readily
agreed, and the King of Bavaria, a warm friend
of La Valette’s, heartily approved. But the notion
became known to the police, and the Bavarian regiment
was constantly surrounded by spies enough to
arrest the whole battalion.</p>

<p>At last, after waiting eighteen days, Baudus
came with the joyful news that certain Englishmen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
in Paris were willing to give their help in furthering
the escape. A Mr. Michael Bruce was the first
to move in the business. He was well received in
the best French society, and he was approached by
certain great ladies, chief among them the Princesse
de Vaud&eacute;mont. Bruce was delighted when invited
to assist a distinguished but unfortunate person,
unjustly condemned to death, and he at once took
into his confidence a British general, Sir Robert
Wilson, who had already chivalrously essayed to
save the life of Marshal Ney. In common with
many of his countrymen he had felt that the hard
fate meted out to Napoleon’s chief adherents was a
disgrace to the country which had played so large
a part in the Emperor’s overthrow. Wilson readily
agreed, and took upon himself to make the necessary
arrangements. Bruce did not appear; his known
sympathy for Ney would have laid him open to suspicion,
and he might have drawn the attention of
the police to his movements and exposed La Valette
to detection. Sir Robert Wilson sought assistants
among the younger officers of the Army of
Occupation, and finally chose Captain Allister of
the Fifth Dragoon Guards and Captain Hely-Hutchinson
of the Grenadier Guards, afterwards
the third Earl of Donoughmae. After some discussion
it was settled that La Valette should assume
the disguise of a British officer, and as such
should travel to the frontier by the Valenciennes
road to Belgium, that generally taken by the English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
officers then in Paris. Some little difficulty
was found in obtaining the necessary uniform, but
it was at last made to La Valette’s measure by the
master tailors of his Majesty’s guards.</p>

<p>On the evening of the ninth of January, 1816,
La Valette bade farewell to the hosts, who had so
nobly protected him and walked as far as the rue
de Grenelle, where he found a cabriolet awaiting
him, driven by the same faithful friend, the Comte
de Chasseuon, by whose aid he had escaped from
the Conciergerie. They passed the tall railings of
the Tuileries gardens, and laughed at the long series
of sentinels, any one of whom would have gladly
checked their progress, and at length reached the
rue du Hilder, where Captain Hely-Hutchinson had
an apartment. His three English friends, Sir Robert
Wilson, Hely-Hutchinson and Michael Bruce,
were there to welcome him, and they all sat down
to talk rapidly over the important adventure fixed
for the following day. The general was very precise
in his instructions. They must be moving early,
awake and up at 6 o’clock. La Valette was as
spruce and smart as became a captain in the guards.
“I shall call for you at 8 <span class="small">A. M.</span> in my own open
cabriolet, as I mean to drive you myself as far as
Compi&egrave;gne,” said he. “Hutchinson, here, will accompany
us on horseback.”</p>

<p>All happened as planned. Although some surprise
was expressed at the sight of a general officer
in full uniform, driving in a gig, no questions could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
be addressed to a person of his rank. The guards
turned out and saluted, and the barrier of Clichy
was reached without accident; then the first post-house
at La Chapelle, where the horse was changed.
Here a party of gensdarmes seemed disposed to
be inquisitive, but Captain Hely-Hutchinson dismounted
and gossiped with them on the coming
arrival of troops. More gensdarmes were encountered
along the road, but none accosted them, and
La Valette hugged his pistol close and would have
resisted recapture. There was a long halt at Compi&egrave;gne
awaiting the general’s large carriage, which
Captain Ellister was bringing after them from
Paris. It was during this half that Sir Robert
Wilson, having caught sight of some straggling
gray hairs beneath La Valette’s wig, produced a pair
of scissors and deftly acted as barber in removing
them. Taking the road in the new carriage they
sped along rapidly through the night, and reached
Valenciennes, the last French town, at 7 o’clock in
the morning. Here the captain of gendarmerie on
duty summoned them to his presence to exhibit their
passports, but Sir Robert Wilson refused haughtily.
“Let him come to me. It is not the custom for a
general officer to wait on captains. There are the
passports; he can do as he pleases.” It was bitterly
cold, the officer was abed and did not care to turn
out, but gave the passports his <i>vis&eacute;</i> without more
ado. A last obstacle offered in the person of an
officious custom-house officer, but he was quickly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
satisfied, and the frontier was passed in safety.
Some close chances had been surmounted on the
way. They ran the risk of detection at the various
post-houses, where the carriage was examined
closely and the passengers interrogated. Once the
identity of La Valette was questioned; he was travelling
under the assumed name of Colonel Losack,
and no such name could be found in the British
army list, but Sir Robert Wilson carried it off with
a high hand. A nearer danger was that La Valette
had very marked features, and he was well
known to many officials, having been Napoleon’s
Postmaster General, while the hand-bills notifying
the escape and describing him in detail had been
very widely distributed. At one town, Cambray,
a dangerous delay occurred through the obstinacy
of the English sentry at the gate, who refused to
call up the guardian to pass them through during
the night. He had received no orders to that effect
and was deaf to all entreaties, although they came
from a general officer.</p>

<p>From Valenciennes the carriage proceeded to
Mons, and arrived there in time to dine. La Valette
then continued his journey towards Munich,
where he was most hospitably received by the Elector
of Bavaria. Sir Robert Wilson made the best of
his way back to Paris by another road, and arrived
in the capital after an absence of no more than
sixty hours. Now misfortune came upon him, and
the three generous and disinterested friends fell into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the hands of the police. One of the innumerable
spies on the lookout for La Valette came upon Sir
Robert Wilson’s carriage, covered with mud in the
stable, and learned that the general had just returned
after a long journey to the North. The
general’s servant was found, and, being questioned,
admitted that the general had just been to Mons
with an officer of the guards who could not speak
English. A watch was set on this servant, who was
the general’s messenger when communicating with
the British Embassy. The servant was suborned,
and for a price promised to bring any letters written
by Sir Robert first to the Pr&eacute;fet of Police. One was
addressed to Earl Grey in London, and it contained
a full and particular account of the escape. On the
strength of the evidence thus unfairly obtained, the
three Englishmen, Wilson, Hely-Hutchinson and
Bruce, were arrested.</p>

<p>The English ambassador, Sir Charles Stuart, declined
to interfere on behalf of his compatriots.
His answer was that these gentlemen had broken
the law by interfering with the course of French
justice, and they must abide by their acts. Accordingly,
they were lodged in the prison of La Force,
and in due time brought to trial at the Assize Court.
Sir Robert Wilson appeared in the dock in the full
uniform of a general officer, his breast covered with
decorations and orders, for he had served with
great distinction, and was especially favored by the
continental sovereigns, whose troops he had often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
led on the field. Captain Hely-Hutchinson wore the
uniform of an officer of the British guards. Mr.
Michael Bruce appeared as a private gentleman.
All admitted the truth of the charge, and it was not
thought necessary to advance proof, but Madame
de La Valette (who had been detained six weeks
in prison) was brought into court and questioned.
She evoked much respectful sympathy, and was
overcome with deep emotion at the sight of her
husband’s chivalrous preservers. “I have never
seen any of them before, but I shall never forget
them and all that I owe to them so long as I live,”
was her cry.</p>

<p>When put upon their defence, the prisoners all
boldly justified their conduct. “The appeal made
to our humanity and national generosity,” declared
Sir Robert Wilson, “was irresistible. We would
have done as much for the most obscure person in
the same dread situation. Perhaps we were imprudent,
but we would rather incur that reproach than
that of having abandoned a man in sore straits, who
threw himself into our arms.” “Whatever respect
I owe this tribunal,” added Mr. Bruce, “I owe it
also to myself to affirm that I do not feel the slightest
compunction for what I have done.” The judge
summed up impartially, but declared that the law
must be vindicated, and a verdict of guilty was returned,
followed by the minimum sentence of three
months’ imprisonment. The large verdict of public
opinion was and still is entirely in their favor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Even the outraged majesty of the French law was
soon soothed, for the Government repented of its
vindictive treatment of men, whose chief offence
was loyalty to a fallen master, and, although unhappily
they could not bring the gallant Marshal
Ney to life, they pardoned La Valette and suffered
him to return to France. The hardest measure
meted out to the two officers came from their military
superiors. The Duke of York, Commander-in-Chief
of the British army, forfeited their commissions
with a scathing reprimand. The infraction
of discipline was soon condoned by the nobility
of the action, and ere long the offenders were reinstated
in their commands.

<p>Some attempt was made in 1810 to improve the
French prison system, and the <i>maisons centrales</i>, or
district prisons, were instituted; but no great progress
was made with them. At that time the principal
punishment inflicted was labor in chains at the
seaports in the so-called <i>bagnes</i> of Brest, Rochefort
and Toulon, or the <i>travaux forc&eacute;s</i>, the survival of
the old galleys, the population of which found a
permanent home ashore, when the warships ceased
to be propelled by human power. These <i>bagnes</i>
will now be described. The earlier records have
already been given in the volume immediately preceding.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>The name <i>bagnes</i>, which was at one time in general
use to express these hard labor prisons, is derived
from <i>bagnio</i>, the bath attached to the Seraglio
at Constantinople, which was the Turkish establishment
for galley slaves. The <i>bagnes</i> were sometimes
known as <i>prisons mouill&eacute;s</i>, or floating prisons,
because the prisoners were for a long time housed
in hulks; but as their numbers increased, buildings
were at length erected on the shore, containing vast
dormitories, each capable of holding five or six
hundred prisoners. The grand total at the Naval
Arsenal often exceeded several thousand men. The
r&eacute;gime was not exactly severe. The labor was easy,
and consisted of little more than rough jobs about
the wharves, moving guns to and fro, storing shot
and shell, occasionally excavating for new buildings.
As described by an eye-witness, penal labor
was a mere farce. “The bulk of the convicts,”
wrote the Director of Naval Arsenals, in 1838, “do
no more than doze. They may be seen, eight or
ten of them, following a light cart, not half laden,
which they pull in turn, two and two. The hospital
is full of them as invalids or nurses. They are to
be found in private houses and hotels, engaged as
private servants.” In earlier days things had been
much worse.</p>

<p>Under the Directory and under the First Empire
many who possessed private means were allowed to
purchase improper privileges. A certain old convict
at Rochefort was allowed to go at large in the town,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
where he was admitted into society and welcomed
for his affable manners. He went so far as to make
overtures to the authorities to purchase his release,
by building and equipping a ship-of-war at his own
expense. It was said in those days that Napoleon I
was willing to forgive crimes at a price; that big
robberies were sometimes condoned by a gift to the
State. One convict, Delage, sentenced for embezzlement,
was a man of large private fortune, which
he was allowed to spend freely in ameliorating his
condition. He arrived at Rochefort in a carriage
and pair, escorted by two gensdarmes. He was located
in a separate room at the Hospital, which he
furnished comfortably, and later his wife and children
joined him at the <i>bagnes</i>. He was in the
habit of leaving the prison every morning at gun-fire
to spend the day with his family, and return in
the evening, on the excuse that he had a situation in
the port, and must sleep on board the ship. This
man was known as <i>le joli for&ccedil;at</i> on account of his
good looks and pleasant demeanor. Others of the
same class were to be seen parading the town in
fashionable garb, bearing the badge of their real
position only in the basil, or ankle-iron, which all
were obliged to wear. Criminals with accomplishments
or skill in trades could always find remunerative
employment. Private families found tutors for
their children and music or dancing masters in the
<i>bagnes</i>, while all high officials might employ convict
coachmen, grooms and cooks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>For the rest, life was irksome. The progress of
the ordinary prisoner has been well described by
Maurice Alhoy, who paid many visits of inspection
to the various <i>bagnes</i>. The journey to the coast
was made in the cellular carriage, which came into
use in 1830, in substitution for the abominable chain
gang, by which the wretched <i>for&ccedil;ats</i> marched
through France. The way was long, the coach
moved at a foot pace, there was no rest or ease on
the road. On arrival the passengers, broken with
fatigue, were carried to the reception ward, identified,
examined, stripped of their clothes and
dressed in the uniform of the <i>bagne</i>,&mdash;a crimson
blouse, yellow pantaloons and a coarse canvas shirt.
These clothes were covered with marks, the first
syllable of the word <i>gal&eacute;rien</i>, “GAL,” in black
letters. A woollen cap of red or green, according
to the term of sentence, covered the head. When
dressed and passed fit for full labor (<i>grande
fatigue</i>), the coupling took place. For long years
French <i>for&ccedil;ats</i> were chained together in pairs, and
the merest chance decided upon the chain companionship.
The pair, thus indissolubly joined for
a term of years, might begin as perfect strangers
to each other, having nothing in common, neither
ways nor tastes, not even language. The coupling
was accomplished by first riveting an iron ring
above the ankle, to which one end of the chain was
attached, the other end being riveted to the ankle
of his fellow. The whole chain measured nine feet,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
half of it belonging of right to each. But if each
had different ideas and intentions, they naturally
pulled in opposite directions, the limit of difference
being reached at nine feet. Sometimes, as at the
hour of mid-day rest, there was a difference of
opinion between the partners. One might wish to
walk, the other to be quiet; but the to and fro movement
of the first dragging at the chain would disturb
the second, and then the matter could only be
settled by a fight or a compromise. To quarrel was
to risk punishment, so the usual course was for one
to take out a pack of cards and cry: “<i>Je te joue tes
maillons</i>,” “I will play you for your half of the
chain.” The game would proceed calmly while the
stake, the disputed chain, lay coiled between the
players; and in the end, according to the issue, both
would walk, or both would lie down to sleep. Often
enough one of a couple was quite indifferent as to
the behavior of his chain-companion. A case was
known where a fight was started between a <i>chaussette</i>,
or convict, permitted to go about singly, and
one of a chain couple. In the course of the struggle
the second and passive member of the twins, who
had watched it quite unconcernedly, was dragged
nearer to the edge of a deep ditch by his companion,
into which both were nearly precipitated. Had not
the conflict ceased both would probably have been
drowned.</p>

<p>The first three days after arrival were allowed for
rest and recovery. On the fourth day at gun-fire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
(6 <span class="small">A. M.</span> in winter and 5 <span class="small">A. M.</span> in summer) the
new arrival’s chain was released from the bar, which
ran the length of the wooden guard bed, the night’s
resting-place for all, and he was marched out with
his fellow convict to labor. On passing through the
great gates a blacksmith struck with a hammer upon
the leg iron to test its solidity. A short pause followed
for the issue of a ration of sour wine, and the
parties were then distributed to the various works
in hand. It was for the most part unskilled labor,
mere brute force applied to moving heavy burdens.
They were harnessed like beasts to carts, laden with
stone, or set to work in gangs at raising the great
weight of the pile driver, or operating the steel
drill, driven down into the solid rock. But work
was continued incessantly and in all weathers, “rain
or shine,” in the pelting storm and under the fierce
rays of the summer sun, with a short rest at mid-day;
bodies thrown down anywhere they stood,
when the signal was given. Work went on for ten
hours daily until the hour of return to the <i>bagne</i>,
where the evening meal, the common feed at the
trough, awaited them. Each squad, a dozen or
more, gathered round the same <i>gamelle</i>, or great
tub, filled with a mess of bean soup, into which they
dipped their wooden spoons, fighting like dogs over
a bone, each for his portion. The weakest fared
worst, and the strongest and greediest carried off
the lion’s share. The same vessel was passed from
hand to hand, and they drank foul water with dirty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
mouths. After the sorry feast an hour or two of
idleness followed, and the convicts lay on the great
wooden bed (<i>rama</i>), conversing with one another.
At last the whistle for all to “turn in” was heard,
when every one, without undressing, rolled himself
in his grass blanket, and sought oblivion, often
vainly, in sleep. Nothing now broke the silence but
the footsteps of the night watchman going his
rounds under the dim light of the oil lamps, and the
occasional falling of his hammer as he struck the
bars and chains to be certain that they had not been
tampered with. When this was done just before
the rising hour it was called “morning prayer.”</p>

<p>Use becomes second nature, and many <i>for&ccedil;ats</i>
could bring themselves to endure the miseries and
discomforts of the life at the <i>bagne</i>. They had their
hours of relaxation, which they spent in the manufacture
of fancy articles, to be sold for the few
francs that helped to increase and improve their
daily rations according to their taste. Some kept
and trained dogs to perform marvellous tricks or
taught mice to draw a carriage. A convict well
known in his time, nicknamed Grand Doyen, who
had done forty out of sixty years in various prisons,
is remembered for his extraordinary power of taming
rats. By a strange contrast this Grand Doyen
was a man of cruel character and abominable
temper, who was ever at enmity with his fellows.
He was constantly in gaol, now for fraud, now for
robbery with violence, at last for murder, with extenuating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
circumstances. He spent all his life, from
the age of nineteen, in detention of some sort. No
one liked him, and in his loneliness he captured a
young rat, and trained it to live with him. He began
by drawing its teeth and shortening its tail. He
taught it all kinds of tricks, harnessed it to a cart,
and secured it with a collar and chain, which he
fastened to a waistcoat button, leaving sufficient
length to the chain to allow the vermin to shelter in
his waistcoat pocket. Once, when at Bic&ecirc;tre waiting
for a chain, Grand Doyen let the rat loose to
run about the yard, where it was pounced upon by
the prison cat. Grand Doyen, in defence of his pet,
promptly killed the cat with his wooden sabot.
Then the rat got into trouble by gnawing a hole in
a convict’s clothes, and an order for his execution
was forthwith issued. Grand Doyen, in despair,
saved his friend by substituting another rat, which
he had caught on purpose, and decorated with the
chain of his favorite before handing it up to justice.
The warder asked why he had not killed the
rat as ordered, and was put off by the excuse that he
had not the heart, so he brought it now to the
warder, who was not so sensitive, and hammered it
on the head with his key. The pet rat was still alive,
safely hidden by Grand Doyen, who was on the
point of removal from Bic&ecirc;tre. How was he to get
it past the gates? Inventiveness was stimulated by
the difficulty, and Grand Doyen, being in possession
of one of those enormous loaves in which French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
ration bread is baked, tore out the crumb in the
centre, and made a comfortable hole for his pet.
Then, carrying his loaf under his arm, he took his
place on the chain, and passed safely through the
gates.</p>

</div>

<p>The ingenuity of the prisoners was equalled by
their industry. The most unpromising materials
and the rudest tools served to produce the most
artistic pieces. Cocoanut shells, beautifully carved,
formed elegant goblets. Old bones were converted
into chessmen or paper knives or penholders, the
tools by which they were shaped being scraps of iron
picked up in the yards. The products of their
cleverness were not always avowable or harmless.
The <i>bagne</i> was often the home of false money
makers, and their audacity must have been something
marvellous. That prisoners employed in the
workshops should be able to escape observation and
manufacture files, keys and other tools to be employed
in compassing escape, was not so strange;
but it was almost incredible, that, working in the
open or under the shelter of a ship’s side, they could
cast metal coins, having first made the molds and
melted the substances, then polish and perfect them
so as to deceive any but the sharpest eye. There
were still more marvellous frauds accomplished.
Forgery and all kinds of imitation of signatures, the
preparation of official documents, even the seals to
attach to them, were within the powers of these
clever convicts. One case is on record, in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
release was all but secured by means of a forged
authority, but at the last moment one document was
missing, and when search was made for it among
the papers in the office, the fraud was discovered.
In this instance several signatures had been imitated,
including that of the Chancellor and the King himself.
On another occasion one of the trade-instructors
received a letter, enclosing a note for five
hundred francs, but unhappily found, when rejoicing
at his good fortune, that the bank-note was false,
although it had deceived many expert persons.</p>

<p>When a certain tradesman got into money difficulties,
and his papers were seized by a sheriff’s
officer, one paper was found amongst them, which
he had been foolish enough to retain. It was a letter
from a convict in the <i>bagne</i> of Rochefort, claiming
payment for the fabrication of a receipt at the instance
of the bankrupt. “May I remind you,” ran
the letter, “that at your request I manufactured a
receipt, for which you promised me two louis, if the
document served its purpose. As it was exactly
what you wanted I now claim the completion of
your promise. You can pass the two louis in to me
by enclosing them in half a pound of butter, which
I can receive at the canteen. I trust that you will
not oblige me to apply to you again.” This letter
was handed over to the police, with the result that
the fraudulent tradesman was arrested and sentenced
to ten years for having made use of the false
receipt.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>The most adroit thieves were to be met with at
the <i>bagne</i>. Extraordinary stories are preserved of
the daring ingenuity and marvellous skill in which
the thefts were carried out. The story is told of
a bishop, who visited the <i>bagne</i>, and who was moved
to great pity for one unhappy criminal, to whom,
after exhortation, he gave his blessing and his hand
to kiss. As usual he carried on his middle finger
his Episcopal ring with a valuable precious stone.
When he left the prison, the ring had disappeared.
It is not recorded in what manner it was abstracted,
nor whether Monseigneur recovered his jewel. On
another occasion a convict actually stole a cashmere
shawl from the back of a visiting lady. The victim
was Mdlle. Georges, a famous actress, who, when
visiting the <i>bagne</i> of Toulon, spoke kindly to several
of the inmates, and was especially drawn to
sympathise with one of good address, who had once
been an actor. This man actually purloined her
shawl, and in triumph started to carry it off, but had
the good taste to bring it back and replace it on
her shoulders, exclaiming, “This is the first time I
have ever made voluntary restitution.” At another
time a watch was stolen from one of the visitors,
who was examining the articles which the convicts
offered for sale. The chief guardian, certain that
the thief must be among a particular group of convicts,
declared that he would flog them in turn until
the watch abstracted had been given back. The
punishment was actually in progress, when the official
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
received a letter from the visitor who had
been robbed, saying that on his return to his hotel
he had been met by a poor creature, dressed in a
ragged old blouse, who approached and handed him
a small parcel containing his watch. It had been
passed out, either by the culprit himself or one of
his comrades, and was now surrendered under threat
of the <i>bastonnade</i>.</p>

<p>An expert thief known in all the <i>bagnes</i> was Jean
Gaspard, who, although crippled and compelled to
walk on crutches, could use his hands, the only good
limbs left him, with wonderful skill. His ostensible
business was that of a wandering beggar, and
he relied upon his infirmities to insinuate himself
into crowds of people. He then worked with ready
skill, and managed to pass his plunder to friendly
accomplices, who removed it to a distance. He
was a professional thief. He had inherited his skill
from his forbears. His father and mother, his
brothers and sisters, all his relatives, in short, were
thieves; and some of them had suffered the extreme
penalty of the law.</p>

<p>Thieving at the <i>bagne</i> was greatly encouraged by
the facilities that offered for getting rid of the
plunder. The business of “receiving” flourished
when the gangs marched to and fro, free people
hanging about, who managed to enter into relations
with the thieves.</p>

<p>The administration of the <i>bagnes</i> left much to be
desired. The discipline was severe, even cruel, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
relied chiefly upon the lash, the <i>bastonnade</i> as it was
called, which might be inflicted for all sorts of offences.
Attempts to escape, extending to sawing
through irons or the assumption of disguises, were
punished by the whip; also a theft of value up to
five francs, drunkenness, gambling, smoking and
fighting with comrades. Any convict might be
flogged, who made away with his clothing, wrote
clandestine letters, or was found in possession of a
sum of more than ten francs. There were graver
penalties for escape and recapture. In the case of
a convict sentenced for life, the punishment for
escape, upon recapture, was three years of the
double chain&mdash;that is he was kept in close confinement,
and not allowed to go to work in the open
air. An extension of the term of imprisonment by
three years was the punishment for those sentenced
to shorter terms. A theft of more than five francs
was met with extension of term. Last of all the
guillotine was the penalty for striking an officer or
killing a comrade, or for entering into any combined
plan of revolt.</p>

<p>Repression and safe custody were the guiding
principles of the <i>bagnes</i>. Their supreme rulers,
who were always naval officers, commissaries of the
marine ranking with captains, might at times realise
that they had a higher duty than that of keeping
a herd of black sheep, but any idea of amelioration
or improvement rarely entered their heads. They
were rough old sailors, of coarse manners, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
little of the milk of human kindness, imposing their
authority harshly, exacting submission with a word
and a blow. Some revolting stories are preserved
of the cruelties of the <i>garde-chiourmes</i>, the slang
name of the officers of the bagne.</p>

<p>Several couples of convicts were once at work
unloading a cargo of wood. Some sorted out the
wood, while others levelled a mound of earth and
piled up the barrows, which were dragged away.
One of a chained couple suddenly struck work, declaring
that he could hardly stand, from fever and
weakness. “You shall go to hospital to-morrow,”
replied his officer. “Go on working now. I will
give you a dose of medicine to help,” and with that
he applied his stick to the poor creature’s back. His
comrade thereupon charged himself with the whole
labor, and drew the barrow alone, while the sick
man staggered along, becoming worse and worse
every moment, and unable even to carry the weight
of the chain. Then his companion lifted him in his
arms on to the barrow, and proceeded to drag it
along. The guardian, resenting this act as defiance
of his will, applied his stick to the back of the good
Samaritan, calling forth redoubled effort, which
ended in the upset of the barrow, which dragged
over the sick man, who died then and there. This
story is vouched for by an eye-witness of the
atrocity. He rewarded the kindly convict, and
would have reported the guardian, but was afterwards
unable to recognise him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>The r&eacute;gime, as we have seen, was tyrannical, but
it must often have been lax, to judge by the frequency
of the escapes at the <i>bagnes</i>. The regulations
were stringent. Notice of an escape was immediately
proclaimed by three guns, and flags were
run up at all commanding points. At the same time
the personal description of the fugitive was circulated
through the neighborhood, and brigades of
gensdarmes were sent in pursuit. Handsome rewards
were offered for recapture; twenty-five francs
(five dollars) if it was effected within the port,
double that amount if within the town and one
hundred francs (twenty dollars) for apprehension
beyond the walls. In spite of all, the determination
to break prison, a fixed idea with all animals in
captivity, was always present with the inmates of the
<i>bagne</i>. It has well been said that the prisoner, in
his endeavors to escape, displays skill and energy
enough to win him inevitable success in any reputable
line of life. The stories of the results achieved
at the <i>bagnes</i>, the conquest of many difficulties, the
triumph over all surveillance, imperfect, perhaps,
but systematic and generally alert, read like a fairy
tale.</p>

<p>One undefeated convict, by name Petit, escaped
continually. He was always getting the better of
his gaolers. He took a pride in stating precisely
the hour at which he would arrive at Toulon and the
day upon which he would leave it a free man. The
event always came off exactly. Petit, at one time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
when recaptured, after escaping from Brest, was
lodged in the prison at Abbeville. He at once
warned the prison officials that he could not stay in
such an unsatisfactory prison. On the next day he
had disappeared. He had broken into a room where
the linen was kept, climbed several high walls, fell
at length into the garden and got out and away,
although his two feet were chained together. He
got rid of his irons outside the walls, and had the
audacity to return and sell them openly in the
market place of Abbeville.</p>

<p>Opportunity and good luck usually favored escape.
Hautdebont was a convict tailor employed
in the workshops where the guardians’ uniforms
were made up. He caught sight of a new suit
hanging on a peg, which he calculated would fit
him, and at a moment when the master-tailor’s eye
was withdrawn, Hautdebont took down the uniform,
put it on and walked out. Unhappily for the
fugitive the suit was immediately missed. The foreman
tailor raised an alarm, and Hautdebont was
quickly caught and sentenced, among other penalties,
to lose his place in the tailor’s shop. Excessive
bad luck was the portion of the convict who had
exactly calculated that, by surmounting the boundary
wall at a particular point, he would reach a certain
retired and solitary street. All went well till,
having surmounted the wall, he lowered himself
on the far side to fall straight into a cart, where a
guardian was taking his mid-day rest. He awoke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and snapped greedily at the hundred francs’ reward
which had fallen straight into his hands.</p>

<p>Convicts have often to thank their own quick-wittedness
and self-possession for succeeding in attempted
escape. One convict at Brest, helped by a
free workman, who had promised him shelter and
a suit of plain clothes, reached the outskirts of the
town, where he made up as a laborer, concealed his
closely cropped hair under an old hat, borrowed a
barrow and a pick and started off for Orleans as if
he were in search of a job. His leisurely gait and
frequent halts betrayed no feverish desire to get
away. The people gave him <i>bon jour</i> as he passed,
and the gensdarmes whom he met accepted a pinch
of snuff; and he went on his way without interference.
He marched thus for a couple of hundred
miles, taking by-roads, still wheeling his barrow before
him, resting by night in the woods, and at last
reaching Orleans in the heart of France, where he
found friends, who helped him out of the country.</p>

<p>Ingenuity and boldness of plan of escape were
often equalled by the limitless patience with which
it was pursued. More than once a long passage
was tunnelled underground, leading to liberty beyond
the Arsenal walls, and this in spite of surveillance
and the galling inconvenience of carrying
chains. In one case a space had been contrived at
the end, large enough to contain the disguises, into
which the fugitives were to change when the moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
arrived, and to store the food saved up for the
journey. The paving stones were taken up, and
places of concealment contrived beneath to hide the
intending fugitive until pursuit had passed on.
Once a man got within a heap of stones, and presently
more stones were brought outside to add to
the heap. He narrowly escaped being built in alive.
By desperate efforts he broke through and gained
the boundary wall, which he escaladed, and fell into
the arms of a couple of fishermen on the far side,
who seized him and took him back to the <i>bagne</i>.
The promised reward was generally too strong a
temptation to working men to let a fugitive go free.</p>

<p>There were convicts with no sense of loyalty to
their comrades, always ready to betray an intended
escape, eager to gain the reward. Others, again,
had invented a strange business, that of giving
assistance to a comrade, resolved to attempt an
escape, by helping him in the work of excavation,
or of standing sentinel to prevent surprise by the
guard. On the arrival of any convict, known to be
well furnished with funds, he was approached by
these friends with proposals. Sometimes the kindly
convict made a double coup,&mdash;for when he had
started to escape he betrayed the plot and was paid
the authorised reward by the other side. The
guards sometimes encouraged an attempt to escape,
and then turned on the would-be fugitive after he
had gone so far from the prison to be worth the full
sum of a hundred francs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>Great cleverness in preparing, and promptitude
in assuming, a disguise was frequently shown. One
convict manufactured the whole of an officer’s uniform
out of paper, which he painted and completed
so as to escape detection. Petit, who has been
mentioned already, whose escapes were almost miraculous,
got away once from the court at Amiens,
after being recaptured, by entering the dressing-room
of the advocates, where he stole a robe and
wig, in which he walked out into the street. A
convict named Fichon, at Toulon, disappeared so
effectually that it was concluded he had left for
good. But he was still on hand, although the most
minute searches were fruitless. He had hidden
under water in the great basin of the dockyard, and
had arranged a leather duct to bring him air from
the surface. At night he emerged from his moist
asylum, landed, ate his food, placed for him by his
friends, and at daybreak took to the water again.</p>

<p>Long brooding on the impossibilities of regaining
freedom has been known to produce mania.
An Italian, named Gravioly, at the <i>bagne</i> of Rochefort,
was driven mad by his failures to escape. He
was sentenced for life after three brutal attempts
to murder. The hopelessness of his condition led
him to secrete a knife, with which he suddenly
wounded the adjutant of the day, broke his chain
and ran amuck through the prison, brandishing his
weapon and attacking all who tried to stop him.
Another adjutant fell before him, and the guard at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
the gate he killed. Another murderer, of exemplary
prison character, after years of good behavior
in the maritime hospital, struck one of the nursing
sisters a fatal blow, which severed her head. It was
supposed that she had discovered his intention to
escape, and he was unable to persuade her to hold
her tongue. In these days we should call this man
a homicidal maniac, but he was executed; and, on
mounting the scaffold, smiled pleasantly at the
guillotine.</p>

<p>The disciplinary methods at the <i>bagnes</i> were
brutal enough, but the severity of the system was
softened by privileges and concessions, that would
not be tolerated in any modern prison. It was
much the same as in Australia in the early days and
at this moment in the Spanish penal colony at Ceuta.
The freedom given to some convicts in service naturally
favored escape, and in one case a high official
was robbed of his full uniform by a convict employ&eacute;,
who, having changed his costume, mounted
his master’s horse and rode off through the principal
gate, after having received the compliments
of the sentries and guards at the grand entrance.
When the reins were tightened and these improper
privileges were forbidden, others of a minor and
mitigating character still survived. There were
situations in the service of the prison, as sweepers,
barbers, cooks and lamplighters. Some became
gardeners, others coopers, more were nurses and
bedmakers in the hospital, and a few were permitted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
to act as hucksters in the sale of food and
condiments within the prison buildings. A post
of great profit was that of <i>payole</i> or prison scribe,
which was given to an educated convict who was
allowed to write the letters of his comrades. The
<i>payole</i> became the confidant of every one, and knew
all their most precious secrets. Often enough he
abused his position, and, after eloquently stating
the case to a prisoner’s family, would misappropriate
the funds forwarded by soft-hearted relations.
The <i>payole</i> was constantly the author of the so-called
“Jerusalem letters,” the equivalent of the
begging letter or veiled attempts at blackmail, which
often issued in large numbers from the <i>bagnes</i>.</p>

<p>Reference has been made already to the ingenious
manufacture of articles for sale, but a less honorable,
although more profitable, trade was that of
usury, which long flourished in the <i>bagnes</i>. The
business was started by an ex-banker named Wanglen,
who was condemned to <i>travaux forc&eacute;s</i> in the
time of the Empire. He brought with him to the
<i>bagne</i> a certain amount of capital, carefully concealed,
and with the skill acquired in his business he
trafficked in usury, and made advances, like any
pawnbroker, upon the goods and valuables secretly
possessed by his fellows as well as upon the <i>p&eacute;cule</i>
or monthly pittance accorded as wages to the convicts.
He had so large a trade that he created a
paper currency to take the place of the specie so
generally short in the prison. But his business suffered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
seriously from the competition that might have
been expected in such a place; for after a time his
notes were cleverly imitated by forgers, and he had
no redress but to return to cash payments. This
man Wanglen is said to have made a great deal of
money by the time he retired from business, and to
have had many successors. When a borrower could
offer no tangible security the good word of a convict
reputed to be a man of substance was accepted
instead; and such men were to be found in the
<i>bagnes</i>.</p>

<p>A notable one was the celebrated Collet, whose
criminal career will be detailed further on. Collet,
strange to say, was always in funds. According
to M. Sers, who wrote at some length on the <i>bagnes</i>,
from facts under his own observation, Collet, during
the twenty years of his imprisonment, was never
known to hold a single centime more, in the hands
of the official paymaster, than the regulation allowance,
yet he lived luxuriously the whole of these
twenty years. He always wore respectable clothing
and the finest underlinen, very different from that
supplied by the prison; he lived on the fat of the
land, despising the mess of pottage, the horrible
haricot of beans, that made up the daily ration. He
was supplied always with abundant and succulent
repasts from the best hotel in the town. The
source of his wealth and the means used to bring
it to his hand were secrets never divulged during
his long term of imprisonment, although inquiries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
were constantly made, and every effort tried to unravel
the mystery. The secret died with him; and
even after death nine pieces of gold were found
sewn into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>The authorities in due course set their faces
against these convict usurers, called <i>capitaines</i>,
whose processes were very properly condemned as
tending to demoralise convicts and aggravate their
miserable condition. A very strict surveillance was
instituted, and when detected the <i>capitaines</i> were
severely punished. Sometimes they were flogged;
but other methods were tried, one in particular, calculated
to bring the culprit into ridicule, always a
potent weapon in dealing with Frenchmen. The
prison barber was ordered to shave the culprit’s
head, leaving one lock only upon the crown. He
was then dressed as an old woman, and made to
sit upon a barrel at the entrance to the prison, where
he was exposed to the jeers of his comrades on
their return from labor. The same measure was
meted out to the <i>capitaine’s</i> assistants, for the big
men always employed a number of agents or canvassers
in extending their business.</p>

<p>Thus, it is seen, that ours is a world of worlds,
one within the other; and assuredly the prison
world is not less interesting, though much less inviting
than many others held in greater esteem.

remarkable escapes.</p>

<p>The quality of the criminals upon which the
<i>bagne</i> laid its hands will be best realised by describing
one or two of the most notable convicts who
passed through them.</p>

<p>A very remarkable person was Anselme Collet,
who has had few equals in his nefarious profession,
that of swindler on the widest scale. He was essentially
the product of his age, which undoubtedly
encouraged his development and afforded him peculiar
facilities for the display of his natural gifts.
Chief among these were boundless audacity, readiness
of resource, an attractive person, insinuating
address, and skill to assume many different parts.</p>

<p>Collet was born at Belley, in the department of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
the Ain, and from his earliest days gave evidence
of a desire to go wrong. He was a born thief and
an unmitigated liar, and as he was constantly in
trouble his family handed him over to a maternal
uncle, a priest, on the point of expatriating himself
because he could not take the oath exacted from all
ecclesiastics. Three years later Collet returned
from Italy and entered the military school at Fontainebleau,
and was presently incorporated as a sub-lieutenant
in an infantry regiment. He had seen
too much of the priests to take kindly to soldiering,
and when in garrison at Brescia, he spent more time
in the Capuchin monastery than in the barracks.
Soon after this his regiment went on service, and
he was seriously wounded. While in hospital at
Naples he nursed a French major, who died in his
arms and gratefully bequeathed him all he possessed,
a sum of three thousand francs and some
valuable jewelry. When Collet was discharged
from the hospital, he joined the monks and was
associated with a body of missioners destined for
La Pouille. Collet’s task was that of treasurer.
Returning to his monastery on one occasion, he
found himself short of three thousand francs, which
he had embezzled, and he saw nothing for it but
flight. He had been kindly received by the syndic
of the town, from whose office he had stolen a number
of passports signed in blank. He had no intention
of staying at the monastery, and persuaded
the superior that he had an inheritance to claim in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
France, to which, being a deserter, he dared not
return. He got a letter of introduction to a banker
at Naples, and was entrusted with a valuable diamond
ring and commissioned to buy another like
it in that city. Collet managed to swindle the
banker out of 22,000 francs, kept the ring, bought
a smart suit of clothes and, filling up a blank passport
as the Marquis de Darda, proceeded to Capua.
Here he picked up a portfolio containing the papers
of Chevalier de Tolozan, which title he now adopted
with the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor, and
passed on to Rome. Here he found a French ecclesiastic,
a native of Lyons and an intimate of the
Tolozan family, who took Collet under his wing and
introduced him to Cardinal Fesch, Napoleon’s uncle
and the then Archbishop of Lyons. Collet made
the most of his time, and swindled people, right
and left,&mdash;60,000 francs here and 20,000 there;
5,000 and 10,000 more borrowed under false pretences,
with jewels stolen from tradesmen, and
moneys craftily secured. Rome became too hot for
him. He filled up a new passport, called himself a
bishop, changed costume and character and went to
live in the city of Mondovi, safe from the police,
already in pursuit of him. Well furnished with
funds Collet threw off his guise of priest, and led
a life of pleasure with the young dandies of the
place, among whom he created a desire to perform
in amateur theatricals. Subscriptions were raised,
Collet becoming <i>costumier</i>. He got together a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
wardrobe made up of priest’s robes, military uniforms
and diplomatic dresses, with sham jewelry
and crosses and ribbons of many orders. He soon
made off with this valuable stock in trade, and the
first disguise he assumed was that of a general officer.
He next became a Neapolitan priest, and thus
passed on to Sion, in Switzerland, where he was
received with open arms by the bishop, who appointed
him to the c&uuml;re of a lucrative parish. What
followed may be told in his own words. “I stayed
here five months,” he says, “performing all the
duties of a priest, confessing, marrying, baptising,
visiting the sick and burying the dead. Our church
was in a ruinous condition, and subscriptions had
been raised for its repair and restoration. There
were 30,000 francs in hand, but posing as a man
of wealth I offered to make up the sum necessary
for the new works, and my generosity was soon
seconded by fresh subscriptions. I meant to lay
hands on all and, starting with the money, accompanied
by my architect and others, proceeded to a
neighboring town to purchase pictures, candelabra,
a chalice and so forth. None of these purchases
were paid for in cash. I sent the Mayor back to
Sion, but stayed myself another night, then started
for Strasburg.” Thence Collet took the road to
Germany, and, passing the mountains of the Tyrol,
re&euml;ntered Italy, changing his costume en route continually.
By passing himself off in various characters
he laid everybody under contribution. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
banker at Savona advanced him 100,000 francs, but
he was nearly detected, and he became once more a
bishop, by name Dominico Pasqualini, Bishop of
Monardan, and was received most cordially by his
confr&egrave;re, the Bishop of Nice. Twenty-seven seminarists
were to be ordained next day, and the Bishop
of Nice besought his fellow prelate to examine them.
Collet tried to get out of it by assuring his Eminence
that he saw no necessity for doing so, as it was little
likely the Bishop would desire to ordain “incompetent
asses;” but the Bishop of Nice insisted, and
the Monseigneur de Monardan put on his robes and
assisted in the ordination of thirty-three abb&eacute;s.
Travelling westward Collet arrived at Fr&eacute;jus, en
route for Spain, now the plenipotentiary of his
Majesty, King Joseph, representing the Inspector-General,
and charged with the equipment of the
army at Catalonia. From Fr&eacute;jus he went on to
Draguignan, preceded by official orders to await his
coming, and there commenced to form his staff.
He appointed a half-pay officer as his aide-de-camp,
the son of the sub-pr&eacute;fet at Toulon his private secretary,
named officers of ordnance, commissioners and
pay-masters, and had a suite of twenty persons by
the time he had reached Marseilles. At Marseilles
he laid hands on 130,000 francs in the government
treasury and at Nimes secured about 300,000 more.</p>

<p>His star paled at Montpelier. After spending
an hour on an early parade he went to lunch with
the Pr&eacute;fet, to whom he promised promotion and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
decorations of the Grand Cross of the Legion of
Honor. Upon returning to his hotel he found it in
the hands of the gensdarmes, and himself under
arrest. Collet’s staff shared his fate, and all whom
he had misled were held in custody for several
weeks, while the villain of the piece hourly expected
to be shot. One day the Pr&eacute;fet had a party,
and to amuse them sent orders that Collet should be
brought from his prison under escort. He was left
for a moment alone in the serving-room, from
which there was no exit save through the dining-room.
At this door two sentinels were stationed.
Collet’s wits were at work. While he waited to
make a spectacle for the guests he caught sight of
the white suit of an assistant cook, which had been
left in the serving-room. Hastily putting it on and
taking up a dish of sweets he knocked at the passage
door, and was suffered to go through without recognition
or interruption. He took refuge in a house
close to the Pr&eacute;fecture, and remained there in hiding
while the alarm was given, and search and
pursuit organised.</p>

<p>After escaping from the town he wandered about
the country devising fresh swindles. One of the
most successful of these was at the expense of a bank
at Tulle, where he cashed a forged letter of credit
for 5,000 francs, and got off as far as Lorient. A
clerk of the bank followed him thither, caught him
and handed him over to justice. He was more carefully
held this time, and passed on to Grenoble,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
where he was sentenced to five years of <i>travaux
forc&eacute;s</i>, which by special favor he expiated at Grenoble.
Here he was recognised and denounced by
one of his former staff officers, with the result that
he was sent to Toulon to finish his term. When set
at liberty he fixed his residence at Poussin, in the
department of Ain, where he was kept under surveillance,
but managed to evade it, and proceeded
to commit fresh crimes. At Toulouse he imposed
upon the superior of a religious house, where he
was given shelter. To show his gratitude he proposed
to endow it with a gift of land. The property
was chosen, the purchase agreed upon, but
Collet could not immediately produce the funds, and
his bankers, according to Collet, talked of delaying
completion. Collet meanwhile set himself to borrow
from friends he had beguiled, and managed to
extract 74,000 francs in all from them. Next day
he disappeared.</p>

<p>He played the same trick at Rochbeaucourt in the
Dordogne. Now posing as the Comte de G&ocirc;lo he
desired to purchase a chateau. Using the same
methods as at Toulouse, he again made himself
scarce with the moneys he borrowed. Then he appeared
at Le Mans. He acquired property, and was
on the point of exchanging land for diamonds at a
jeweller’s, when the rumors of former fraud
reached the place, and the police were set on his
track. He was arrested, tried and convicted, and
was sentenced to twenty years at the <i>bagne</i>, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
exposure for an hour in the <i>carcan</i>, or iron collar,
on the platform of the guillotine. He was sent first
to Brest, but was transferred later to Rochefort,
where he died in 1840, having endured his captivity
with philosophy, and not, as has been said already,
in extreme discomfort. “I have but one grief,” he
said in the hospital of the <i>bagne</i>, “and that is that
I am dying a <i>for&ccedil;at</i>. My money is of no use to
me;” for he undoubtedly possessed considerable
funds, although the secret of their whereabouts was
never disclosed. Collet had no small opinion of himself,
and claimed to be an interesting criminal. His
head was turned by the attention he attracted, and
he actually replied in an open letter to the charges
brought against him in the numerous biographies
of him published in his lifetime. He sought to correct
the severity of the criticisms passed upon him,
and protested that the standard of his morality was
put too low. “My life has had two sides,” he represented;
“and, I am free to confess, presents features
I cannot defend; on the other side I can point to
many good deeds. I have given largely to the poor
when I was in funds, and my conduct in prison has
always been irreproachable.”</p>

<p>A few very remarkable convicts contemporary
with Collet may well find mention here. One was
Salvador, whose real name was Jean Ferey. His
prison history includes thirty-two escapes from gaol
and nine from the <i>bagne</i>. He was originally a respectable
man, a tradesman in the north of France,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
who, on returning from one of his business journeys,
found his house deserted. His wife, after
pillaging the place, had run away with a young clerk.
He fell away at once into evil courses, vowed eternal
hatred to society and instantly adopted a life of
crime. He was taken in Paris and sentenced to ten
years’ imprisonment for robbery by means of false
keys. He escaped and was recaptured, finished his
term and was again sentenced for a new burglary.
He had had a violent struggle with the police, in
which he was mortally wounded, as it was supposed,
and was taken to the infirmary of La Force, where
the surgeon bade him prepare for death. His wounds
were deep, his strength was waning and hope abandoned.
Next morning he had disappeared, and was
driving post-haste along the highroad to Switzerland,
in company with a woman, who had assisted
in his escape. He had got out through a hole in
the infirmary wall, and had lowered himself into the
street by a rope made out of his blankets. Then followed
a fresh offence and a new sentence, this time
of death. The night before his execution he volunteered,
with every sign of contrition, to make a full
avowal of his crimes. A judge came to attest his
confession, and, seeing that the prisoner was suffering
acute pain from his chains, ordered his leg irons
to be removed. The story was prolonged far into
the night. The judge, meaning to return the next
morning, left Salvador to sleep entirely unfettered.
He was still well guarded and kept under eye; yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
next day nothing was found of him but his clothes,
which he had been compelled to slip off so as to
effect his passage through the usual hole in the wall.</p>

<p>The woman who, in his first escape, had carried
him off in a post-chaise, became his wife and clung
to him with every mark of loyal affection. Once
Salvador, when in custody, persuaded his guards
to allow her to dine with him in prison. The dishes
were brought in from outside and carefully examined
as they passed the gate, but there was a file
carefully concealed in a stick of celery, with which
the prisoner sawed through his bars and gained his
liberty.</p>

<p>Salvador had a certain pride in his nefarious profession
as well as for his fellow criminals. He could
not bear the idea that any one sentenced to exposure
in the <i>carcan</i>, or collar, upon the scaffold should
appear in a shabby dress; and he was frequently
known to provide them with a suitable costume out
of his own private purse. He had the reputation of
being a staunch and devoted comrade, whose loyalty
to his fellows nothing could shake, and who was
never known to betray a soul. On one occasion, in
a great robbery of goods in a shop, he had gained
the assistance of one of the salesmen. Salvador was
presently taken, and it was clear that it had been a
“put up” job, the slang phrase for collusion from
inside; but when the whole staff of the shop were
assembled, and Salvador was called upon to indicate
his accomplice, he obstinately declined and declared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
that he had never seen a single one of them before.
He ended his days on the guillotine in a <i>bagne</i>. It
was said that he had grown weary of the life of
constant escapes and repeated recapture, and to put
an end to it all had attacked and wounded a warder
so as to incur the extreme penalty of the law.</p>

<p>The <i>bagne</i> had its aristocracy, not of crime only,
but in the actual persons of men of rank and title,
real or fictitious. There was the Marquis de Chambreuil,
who spent many years at Rochefort, and was
always distinguished by his air of good breeding
and exquisite manners. There was a mystery about
him, which was never penetrated, and no one ever
knew his real name. Another pretended nobleman
was the so-called Comte d’Arnheim, who appeared
at Rochefort with the badge of his rank on his convict
cap and his coat of arms embroidered in silk.</p>

<p>The most notable of all such pretenders was the
famous Cognard, commonly known at the <i>bagne</i>
under the name of the Comte de Pontis de Sainte-Hélène,
a man with a curious history, who passed
through many strange adventures and vicissitudes.
He was endowed with many personal gifts, was of
handsome appearance with regular features, had a
firm mouth, a keen eye and a suave voice, which
easily assumed a note of command. He escaped
from Toulon, when a convict sentenced to <i>travaux
forc&eacute;s</i>, and found his way into Spain, where he
somehow made the acquaintance of the family of
Pontis de Sainte-Hélène, the last representative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of which died suddenly, and Cognard became possessed
of his papers. He had military aspirations,
and as one of the old noblesse he easily obtained a
lieutenancy in the French army, in which by varied
service he rapidly rose to the rank of major and
leader of a squadron. As such he served with the
staff of Marshal Soult in the Pyrenees. When the
French army retreated he was appointed to the command
of the 100th regiment of the line. He was
present at the battle of Toulouse, and afterwards
behaved well at Waterloo, where he was seriously
wounded. He went over at the Restoration and
was decorated with the order of Saint Louis, and
was appointed by the Duc de Berry, lieutenant-colonel
of the legion of that nobleman and soldier.</p>

<p>He was playing a bold game and yet he dared to
march at the head of his regiment day after day,
through the streets of Paris, constantly crowded
with old comrades, who might at any time recognise
him. This actually happened at a parade in the
Place de Vend&ocirc;me, when an old friend claimed his
acquaintance, demanding blackmail. This was but
grudgingly given, and the false Count and convict
Lieutenant was denounced to the police. He was
soon faced with the record of his evil antecedents
and re-committed to the <i>bagne</i> at Brest, where he
died.</p>

<p>A strong light is thrown upon the life of the
<i>bagne</i> by one who passed through it in the early
part of the nineteenth century. Readers of French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
memoirs are no doubt familiar with the autobiography
of Vidocq, who, from an active pursuit of
crime in all its forms, went over to the other side
and became a famous thief catcher. His black
treachery to his class, his constant betrayal of his
old confederates, may be said to have been condoned
by the services he rendered society by bringing so
many of the worst depredators to justice; but he
was a contemptible character with no redeeming
points but his pertinacious courage and his unflagging
pursuit of the criminals, whom, renegade that
he was, he hunted unceasingly. The “Memoirs”
he gave to the world have been widely read, and not
less widely discounted as extravagant beyond measure
and probably unveracious. But it is the fact
that they never were contradicted, although many
of the people he exposed were still living when he
wrote, and would certainly have refuted the charges
he brought, had they been false. Withal, the “Memoirs”
are amusing, even fascinating to lovers of
personal adventure, full of hairbreadth escapes,
thrilling exploits and great dangers incurred and
surmounted. They no doubt present a faithful picture
of criminal episodes and the prison treatment of
criminals in his time.</p>

<p>He was confined in the <i>bagne</i> of Brest, from
which he speedily made his escape, and his account
of his life as a convict, his journey from Paris “by
the chain” will be read with interest when contrasted
with the experiences of Jean Marteilhe, the innocent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Protestant galley-slave of just a century before.
Vidocq started from Bic&ecirc;tre, where the travellers,
some one hundred and twenty in number, were assembled
in the forenoon in the <i>cour des fers</i>,
“Court of Irons,” and medically examined as to
their fitness for the march. The commander of the
gang, Captain Thierry, and his lieutenant, M. Viez,
were present, both of long experience and much
respected by all. A ring in the centre of the chain
that joined every two men seemed to take the gang
chain, and the whole twenty-five couples were as
one man. The act of fettering seems to have completed
the degradation of these miserable creatures.
So far from despairing, they gave themselves up to
riotous and reckless gaiety. The most horrible and
disgusting language was heard on every side, wild
shouts and indecent gestures provoked stupid, senseless
laughter. Vidocq himself comments bitterly
upon the scene. It was painfully evident that the
criminal loaded with fetters was goaded into trampling
under foot all that is honored and respected by
the society which has cast him off. He feels no
restraints, no obligations, his charter is the length
of his chain, his only law the stick of his <i>argousin</i>
(guard). When night came on they began to sing.
Imagine fifty scoundrels, the greater number of
them drunk, all screeching different and timeless
airs. Where the few gave way to the horrors of
their situation and wept bitter tears, their abandoned
companions fell upon them and beat them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
That night three of the number charged with the
heinous offence of having betrayed the secrets of
the prison house were all but killed. One indeed,
a noted informer, was only rescued by the <i>argousin</i>,
and he was so misused that he died within four
days.</p>

<p>That first night was passed on the bare stones of
a disused church. At daybreak all were afoot, the
lists were read over, the fetters examined. Then
the larger number mounted long, low cars, back to
back, legs hanging over outside. They were soon
covered with frost and their bodies were motionless
from extreme cold. The balance, made up of the
most robust, were condemned to walk, which at least
kept them warm; and besides they could attack
defenceless people and rob, when they escaped
supervision, which was not always exercised, for the
guards shared in the plunder. On reaching the
first stage out (St. Cyr), all were stripped of their
clothes and a close search made of their person and
of every article&mdash;stockings, shoes, and shirt&mdash;for
hidden files or watch springs likely to be used in
sawing through their irons. This examination
lasted for nearly an hour, while the convicts undressed
and shivered with unendurable cold.</p>

<p>The night resting-place was a cattle shed. The
beds were made on the impure litter, in the midst
of which were set the wooden troughs, filled with a
steaming mess of bean soup, from which each man’s
porringer was filled. At the end of this disgusting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
meal the sergeant blew his whistle for silence.
“Listen, robbers, and answer me ‘yes’ or ‘no.’
Have you had bread?” “Yes.” “Soup?” “Yes.”
“Meat?” “Yes.” “Wine?” “Yes.” “Then
go to sleep or pretend to do so.” In striking contrast
to this mockery of a feast, the guards dined at
a table laid out close by, and abundantly supplied.
“It is not easy to imagine a more hideous spectacle
than this stable,” says Vidocq. “On one side were
a hundred and twenty men, herded together like
foul beasts, rolling their haggard eyes, from which
fatigue and misery had banished sleep. On the
other were eight ugly ruffians, carousing and eating
greedily, but never losing sight of their carbines or
their clubs. A few miserable candles affixed to the
blackened walls cast a murky glare upon the revolting
scene, and the grim silence was constantly
broken by the clank of fetters.”</p>

<p>The toilsome journey occupied twenty-four days
and ended at a depot outside the <i>bagne</i>, where a
sort of quarantine was performed. The prisoners
were bathed two and two, put in the crimson uniform
and rested for three days. No great vigilance was
shown here, and it was easy to get out and over the
outer wall. Vidocq had been meditating escape, and
prepared for it by obtaining private clothes, a shirt,
trousers, and neckerchief, which he concealed in the
centre of an enormous loaf of ration bread. Having
secured a steel chisel, negligently left within his
reach, he cut a hole through the wall of his chamber,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
while a friendly comrade relieved him of his irons.
He gained the yard and the boundary wall, which
he surmounted with the aid of a pole, which was
too heavy to be lifted on top and used for the
descent. At last his only chance was to jump down,
and in doing this he injured his ankles seriously,
and could only drag himself to an adjoining
bush, where he lay for hours, hoping the pain would
abate and he might go on. But his feet swelled
prodigiously, and he was obliged to surrender himself.
Three weeks were now spent in hospital, and
a charitable Sister of Mercy who nursed him gained
him forgiveness from the commandant.</p>

<p>Vidocq was still bent on escape. An obstacle to
his plan existed in his chain companion, of whose
discretion he was afraid. The man was still young,
but already half an idiot from misery and brutal
treatment. It was the rule to blame the remaining
half of a couple, when the other had got away, and
Vidocq knew this man, to avoid punishment, would
betray the projected escape. It was necessary to be
coupled afresh, and Vidocq, feigning sickness, was
laid by for a few days, and then given another
partner, who had no fears and was full of good-will.
He strongly advised the would-be fugitive to
make his move at once, before the sergeants had
come to know his face. He helped Vidocq, who
was in funds, to buy a disguise, a suit of sailor’s
clothing, which was put on the morning of the third
attempt, underneath his convict’s frock, and was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
undetected as the gang passed out of the gate to
labor at dawn. His fetters, which he had sawn
through, only hung by threads, but these also escaped
notice; and on reaching the basin where the
works were in progress, Vidocq slipped aside behind
a pile of planks, where he made a rapid change, and
walked off towards the wicket gate, giving upon the
town. Altogether ignorant of the proper way, after
threading many intricate streets and turning continually
right and left, he luckily reached the main
gate of the city, where a veteran guard was posted,
who had the credit of being able to tell a convict at
a look, and penetrate any disguise. A telltale hang
of one leg, that to which the chain has been fastened,
is an unfailing sign, but Vidocq had not been
coupled long enough to show this. He played his
part very coolly. He was carrying a jug of buttermilk,
bought on purpose, and placing this upon the
ground he halted in front of the warder, and carelessly
asked for a light for his pipe. This self-possession
served him in good stead. He passed safely
through, and three-quarters of an hour elapsed
before the three guns giving the alarm were fired.
He still held on bravely, and all would have gone
well, had not two gensdarmes suddenly appeared
at the turn of the road, and took him into custody,
but not as an escaped convict. With ready wit
Vidocq gave himself up as a deserter from the navy,
the <i>Cocarde</i> frigate then in the roadstead of St.
Malo, near at hand,&mdash;to which he thought to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
returned and to escape from the escort on the
way.</p>

<p>After prolonged detention Vidocq was started
for the coast, when he escaped and passed through
many exciting adventures. For a part of the time
he wandered about the country disguised as a Sister
of Mercy. Then he joined forces with a party of
escaped convicts, who had recognised him. Then
he became a cattle drover, a business in which he
earned good wages, and which took him to Paris.
Danger threatened in the capital, and he worked
north to Arras, in his own country, and on to Brussels
and Rotterdam, where he was pressed into the
Dutch navy. He claimed release as a Frenchman
born, and was speedily identified as the deserter
from the <i>Cocarde</i>. He was carried back into France
as a prisoner, and his fate seemed so uncertain that
he thought it best to proclaim himself Vidocq, an
escaped convict from Brest. He was removed to
Bic&ecirc;tre on a second visit, and to be transferred for
a second time on the chain to one of the <i>bagnes</i>.
His second journey, which took him south, for
Toulon was now his destination, was a repetition
of that already described,&mdash;the most interesting
feature in it being his companionship with a very
noted criminal of that period, Jossas, better known
as the Marquis Sainte Armande de Faral, one of the
most celebrated robbers of Paris. There was very
little of the convict about this prosperous thief.
Although fettered, he wore a smart travelling costume,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
knitted pantaloons of silver gray and a waistcoat
and cap trimmed with Astrakan fur, the whole
covered with a large cloak lined with crimson velvet.
He had ample funds, and fared sumptuously every
evening, when he treated several of his comrades at
dinner. He spent much time daily on his toilet, and
was provided with a splendid dressing-case filled
with all necessaries. His line of business was that
of thefts by means of false keys, and he showed
extraordinary cleverness in getting impressions to
enable him to open the locks of doors and safes.</p>

<p>On reaching Chalons by road the gangs were
transferred to large boats, on which they dropped
down the Rh&ocirc;ne to Lyons, then on as far as Avignon,
where they landed and recommenced the
march. Vidocq and others, who had been guilty of
escape, were condemned to the “double chain” as
it was called. This meant unbroken confinement in
one part of the prison, where they were chained to
the guard bed, which they never left except for a
short period of exercise. The worst characters in
custody were collected here. Vidocq found himself
side by side with several celebrities, notably revolutionaries
who had robbed the royal wardrobe, a
gigantic theft of Crown jewels and priceless treasures
valued in all at half a million pound sterling,
among which was the famous Regent diamond,
sometimes called the “Pitt,” which had been
brought from India by Mr. Pitt, Governor of Madras.
There was also a member of the Cornu family,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the head of which had long terrorised the people
of Lombardy. Disguised as a horse-dealer he frequented
country fairs and attacked merchants who
were carrying large sums of money. He was
greatly assisted by his third wife, who ingratiated
herself with travellers and led them to their death.
This family consisted of three sons and two
daughters, all of them habituated to crime from
their earliest childhood. The youngest girl, Florentine,
showed some repugnance to adopt the criminal
profession. She was cured by being compelled
to carry in her apron, for two leagues, the decapitated
head of a murdered farmer. So rapid is the
degeneration of those who once go astray that this
same Florentine, when her relatives joined a band
of <i>chauffeurs</i>, for her part was to apply the lighted
candle to the feet of their victims, when they refused
to confess the hiding-place of their valuables. The
brother, who was confined at Toulon with Vidocq,
carried on the assumed business of a journeyman,
and was sentenced to the double chain when caught
in the act of committing a burglary.</p>

<p>Vidocq gained the good-will of his guardians by
inducing his companions to pursue prison industries,
and the prison of the double chain became a busy
workshop, where children’s toys and other articles
were manufactured in large quantities. The trade
was profitable, and supplied the funds needed for
undertaking a fresh escape. Vidocq collected materials
for disguise&mdash;a wig and black whiskers and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
an old pair of boots. For the rest he trusted to the
overcoat, hat, cane and gloves of the prison surgeon,
who was in the habit of leaving these unguarded
within Vidocq’s reach. The first attempt
made in this disguise was a failure, the second was
more successful. It had been arranged with the
convict, Jossas, already mentioned, who had provided
him with the plain clothes which he put on
beneath his crimson frock. The rivet in his irons
had been removed, and had been replaced by a movable
screw, and one morning, when issuing forth to
labor, Vidocq slipped behind the pile of wood,
quickly threw off his red shirt and, extracting the
screw, freed himself from his fetters. He ran at top
speed to the basin, where a frigate was in repair,
and jumped into a boat on the point of starting
from the town. Vidocq seized an oar and pulled
manfully towards Toulon, where he landed and
made for the Italian gate. Here he was refused
admittance. The production of a pass, or green
card issued by the Magistrate, was demanded, and
while he was still parleying, the three reports of the
guns announcing his escape were heard. He forthwith
left the gate and, avoiding the crowd, betook
himself to the ramparts, where he was accosted by
a friendly girl, who had penetrated his disguise, but
who sympathised with the convict fugitive. She
promised him a green ticket, which she would borrow
from her lover; but the lover was absent from
home, and recapture seemed imminent, when a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
funeral procession came past. The girl advised him
to mix amongst the mourners. This he did, and
thus passed the gate. Presently he gained the high-road
which led into the open country. It would be
tedious to follow the fugitive in his wanderings, or
to detail the narrow chances he constantly ran of
being captured. His story as a refugee was that of
a hundred others of his class, who had broken prison
and infested all parts of France. As a convict
turned thief catcher his story is vastly different and
of vastly greater interest; as will be seen in the
following pages.

<p>The state of France during the period which has
just been described was deplorable. There was little
security for property, and life was constantly
in danger. Whole bands of fugitive galley-slaves
were at large, pursuing their evil courses with the
utmost daring and effrontery. They were apprehended
from time to time, but were acquitted, when
arraigned, for want of evidence; witnesses as to
identity were not forthcoming, and unless caught
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
red-handed there were no proofs of guilt. To surprise
them and take them into custody knowledge of
their domicile was essential; and they were so cunning
and evasive that it was not easy to ascertain this
fact. It was under these circumstances that justice
in France, in its eagerness to check these depredations
and to protect the deserving, industrious population,
secretly sought the aid of spies and informers
willing to work against the criminal fraternity.
Vidocq was one of the first to go over. He was
weary of the life he led, the unceasing anxiety, the
constant fear of recognition by old associates, the
incessant blackmail to which he was subjected; and
to escape re-arrest he was driven in self-defence to
retaliate and offer his services to the cause of order.
Matters were brought to a crisis when he was called
upon to participate in a series of robberies to be
perpetrated by old convicts, whose hands were
already bloodstained. Vidocq, realising that
whether he refused this proposal or not he must
be compromised sooner or later in other infamous
deeds, resolved to go in person to the Chief of
Police, at that time a M. Henri, an excellent officer,
who rendered eminent service in his day. Vidocq
confided in the Chief, and explained his situation,
saying, if his presence in Paris was tolerated and
he was assured immunity from arrest, he could
promise much valuable information. He could lay
his hands upon great numbers of convicts at large,
knowing precisely their places of residence and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
many of their plans. M. Henri at once declined
to enter into any compact of the kind. All he would
say was: “I have no objection to receiving any
information. We will test it and use it for what it
is worth; perhaps we may accept your services in
the long run, but we can make no promises and
agree to no antecedent conditions. You must take
your chance.” “Under these circumstances I may
consider myself already a dead man,” replied Vidocq;
“for it might come out that I had given information,
and my life would be forfeited.” M.
Henri would not alter his decision, and dismissed
Vidocq without even asking his name.</p>

<p>His overtures thus rejected, and himself still
closely pressed by his evil associates, Vidocq passed
several anxious months. His fears were verified by
the certainty that the suspicions of the police were
aroused, and that his house was watched. His arrest
seemed imminent, and he was resolved to
leave Paris without delay. But he was too late.
One morning, in the small hours, a light knock
came at the street door. Vidocq felt sure that he
was immediately to be arrested. He dressed, and
ran quickly up-stairs, got out upon the roof and hid
himself behind a stack of chimneys. His surmises
were correct, for the house was speedily invested
by police agents, who hunted for him high and low,
and found him where escape was hopeless except
at the risk of breaking his neck. He was carried
at once to the Prefecture and into the presence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
M. Henri, who remembered him perfectly. The
chief, in the interval, had changed his mind. The
increase in crime had led him to believe that Vidocq
might be usefully employed in laying his hands upon
the worst offenders at large. Nothing was said,
however, and Vidocq was removed for a third time
to Bic&ecirc;tre, to take his departure with the next chain
gang. At Bic&ecirc;tre, Vidocq wrote privately to the
Chief of Police, offering his services afresh. He
made no condition but that he should not be sent
back to a <i>bagne</i>, and expressed his willingness to
complete his sentence in any prison in France. M.
Henri still hesitated. One argument militated
against accepting Vidocq’s proposal. This was the
barrenness of the results achieved by others who
had promised largely and performed little. Vidocq
in his own defence appealed to his good conduct
when at large, his continuous efforts to earn an
honest livelihood, the production of his books and
correspondence and many letters, bearing witness
to his probity and good character.</p>

<p>Vidocq was detained between Bic&ecirc;tre and La
Force for nearly two years, and no doubt rendered
useful service as <i>mouton</i>, the French slang word
for a spy who worms himself into the confidence
of his fellow prisoners and denounces them. In
this way he came upon the addresses of numbers of
escaped convicts who were in prison under false
names, and was able to give constant information
of plots in progress for carrying out new crimes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
His reports were closely examined and compared
with others, so as to obtain corroboration or the
reverse. They were so generally accurate that M.
Henri realised the value of this unofficial assistant,
and came to the conclusion that such a man would
be more useful when free. He was at length released
from his probationary detention. To keep
up the deception and to screen him from possible
suspicion and discovery by the comrades he had
betrayed, he was removed from La Force in the
ordinary way, handcuffed and under escort, but en
route to Bic&ecirc;tre was permitted to escape. He went
at once into hiding, and posed amongst his friends
as extraordinarily successful in avoiding recapture.
Of course, he carried his life in his hands and would
have been instantly sacrificed to the vengeance of
those he betrayed, had he been found out. But no
one doubted him. He enjoyed unlimited confidence,
and was always in high favor with the thieves and
bandits, among whom he constantly lived. He was
at home in all the lowest dens of Paris, and was a
trusted member of the criminal fraternity, all of
whom he knew intimately, their favorite haunts and
whereabouts and the schemes in which they were
engaged. He was frequently invited to join in
their depredations and seldom refused, but always
carefully avoided taking part in them by failing at
the appointed rendezvous or inventing some flimsy
excuse for holding aloof. The strange fact is emphasised
by Vidocq, that the dangerous classes are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
singularly simple and unsuspicious. They seemed
to take arrest almost as a matter of course, and seldom
paused to inquire, when once in custody, how
or through whom they had been taken. No one
blamed Vidocq, who was their friend, often their
hero and model for imitation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile robberies of every description continued
to be perpetrated, and Vidocq was more and
more in demand. He made it his business to undertake
a series of rounds through Paris and the immediate
neighborhood, and regularly visited the
worst quarters, ever on the alert to discover and
check projected crimes. He was taken on by the
Prefecture as a salaried agent at the rate of 100
francs per month, with a specially apportioned reward
for every arrest, according to its importance.
This salary was saddled with a condition that he
should produce a certain number of criminals at
regular intervals; and his enemies declared that he
was capable of any base perfidy in order to make
up his required quota of arrests, and that he heartlessly
betrayed people, to whom he was under obligation&mdash;as
in the case of the tanner with whom
he lodged, and whom he secretly denounced as a
fabricator of false money. A medical man who
attended him was implicated in this charge, and
both were arrested and sent to <i>travaux forc&eacute;s</i>. He
was accused also of instigating crimes of which he
gave information, and saw to it that their perpetrators
were taken in the act or with clear evidence. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
may be claimed that in criminal matters all is fair
that may conduce to arrest, although this savors of
the argument that “the end justifies the means.”
Vidocq, at least, had no scruples, and would lay
traps and be guilty of any treachery in order to
bring an offender to justice. He had no reason to
be proud of the manner in which he routed out the
house of Madame Noel&mdash;commonly known as the
mother of the robbers&mdash;which was a certain refuge
and receptacle, where they could always find shelter
and assistance. Mother Noel provided for all their
wants. She always knew where they could find
work, each one on his particular “lay.” She had
blank passports on hand, and could fabricate papers
for any one in want of them. Vidocq visited the
house and acted the part of a convict recently escaped,
still bearing the marks of his chains, with
closely cropped hair, worn out and wearied, his feet
lacerated, his whole air that of one hunted and
proscribed. He won the woman’s sympathy instantly,
and was made warmly welcome. He was
given a bath, his wounds were dressed and he was
put to bed in a very private room. He soon
wormed himself into her confidence, gained all the
knowledge he required, and eventually broke up this
refuge and receptacle so useful to the thieves of
Paris.</p>

<p>The way by which he contrived to come upon
the secret store of a notorious receiver of stolen
goods was more excusable. This man’s operations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
were well known to the police, but they had failed
to bring his crime home to him. Vidocq met him
one day and claimed his acquaintance, calling him
by a name different from his own. The receiver
declared it was all a mistake, but Vidocq persisted,
adding that he knew the man was wanted by the
police. Whereupon the other said: “Let us go to
the nearest police station, where I shall easily find
someone who can speak positively upon my identity
as a resident of this quarter.” It was an incautious
move, for Vidocq, on reaching the station, still refused
to believe that the man was not the person he
had declared him to be, and called upon him with
an air of authority to produce his papers. None
were forthcoming, and Vidocq begged that he might
be searched, when twenty-five double napoleons and
three gold watches were found upon his person,
somewhat suspicious property. The man was now
detained until he could be taken before a magistrate,
and the articles found in his pockets were
wrapped in his own handkerchief. Vidocq, armed
with this, visited the receiver’s house, saw his wife
and showed the handkerchief, which she recognised
at once. “I thought you ought to know,” went on
Vidocq, noticing that she was greatly perturbed,
“that your husband has been arrested. Everything
found on him has been seized, and he believes that
he has been betrayed. I come from him to beg you
to have all the property, you know what I mean,
removed, as these premises are to be searched immediately,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
and something compromising may be
found.” The woman, thoroughly alarmed, begged
Vidocq, whom she looked upon as a friend, to go
out and bring back three hackney coaches. When
they arrived they were loaded up with articles of
every description, timepieces, candelabra, Etruscan
vases, cloths, cashmeres, linens, muslins, etc. At
the proper moment the police surrounded the
coaches, and more than enough was at once found
to convict the receiver.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable robberies in Paris
was that of the collection of old coins and medals
from the Royal Library, now known as the National
Library in the rue Richelieu. This collection
is reputed one of the finest in the world, and, besides
a couple of hundred thousand coins, contains a
great number of cut gems and antiques, dating
back into the earliest times. Cameos, crystals, agate
goblets, bronzes, ivories, sacrificial cups of massive
gold, choice medallions, tankards richly chased by
artists whose names have not survived, and so on,
are among its treasures. The news of the robbery
was received with dismay at the Prefecture. An
immediate inspection made by the police showed
how cleverly the thieves had gained admission to
the cabinet containing the collection of medals.
They gained access to a neighboring house, and
ascended to the roof and slid over the slates to a
garret window in the library. They broke through
this, reached the back stairs and slipped down into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the principal salon. A solid oak door at the north
end of the salon shut off the medal room, but the
thieves sawed through it, and entered the inner
room, which was lighted by a large window opening
on to the rue Richelieu. It was easy enough to break
into the cases, sweep up a large number of the
precious coins and lower them to the confederates in
the street below.</p>

<p>With close examination of the premises the detectives
were satisfied that only one of three famous
burglars could have accomplished the theft. The
work had been executed most cleverly. The panel
in the door had been cut out by a skilled hand. The
saw, left behind, was a very perfect tool. The candle
in the dark lantern, also abandoned, was of the
finest wax, and the rope used was of the best quality.
Only the most expert thief would have expended
so much care and capital upon the enterprise. The
three men indicated were Fossard, a notorious convict,
who should have been in the <i>bagne</i> of Brest,
but had recently escaped and was at large; a friend
of his, Drouillet by name, ex-convict at liberty, and
Toupriant, believed to be then in England.</p>

<p>Light was suddenly thrown upon the mystery
of the theft by the arrest of the first of these men.
Vidocq met him in the street, and remembered his
face, as of one who had passed through his hands
on a previous occasion. This was hardly enough to
justify arrest, but the astute police officer whom
Vidocq informed took the responsibility. The man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
seemed so confused, and his replies were so unsatisfactory,
that he was carried at once to the Prefecture,
where he was at last definitely recognised by various
officials. The fact that this man, Fossard, was in
Paris strengthened the suspicion that he had been
concerned in the robbery of the medals, and he was
at once questioned, after the French manner, to
extract some confession. It was all to no purpose.
Fossard stoutly denied all knowledge of the theft.
The police next tried to bribe him in hope of recovering
at least a part of the stolen property, the intrinsic
worth of which was nothing to its sentimental
value, which was estimated at a million francs.
Fossard persisted in his denials, and was at length
committed to Bic&ecirc;tre to take his place in the next
chain departing for Brest. He waited there for
several months, in such an abject condition and so
destitute of means that his comrades subscribed a
sum to provide him with sabots and a pair of
trousers for his long march. But a clandestine letter
of his was intercepted, in which he begged a friend
to forward him 25,000 francs ($5,000) to Brest,
for his use on arrival at the <i>bagne</i>. He was therefore
clearly in funds.</p>

<p>The effrontery of a woman who posed as the
Vicomtesse de Nays paved the way to further discovery.
This pretended great lady, who was really
the associate of thieves and the wife of one of Fossard’s
friends, was on the best of terms with the
Prefecture, and quite an intimate friend of the Prefect.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
She passed as a charitable person with many
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, whom she was eager to befriend by obtaining
places for them and supplying them with funds
when temporarily in distress. At one of her visits
to the Prefecture she pressed the prefect to honor
her with his company at dinner, and it was quite by
accident that he discovered that his fellow guests
included some of the most notorious criminals in
the capital. Happily for his reputation he discovered
that she was well acquainted with Fossard;
and, yet more, that she had taken places for herself
and maid in the diligence for Brest, where, no doubt,
she was to carry him substantial aid. Other valuable
news was forthcoming, namely; that a number
of the stolen medals had been melted down into
ingots, and that some of them were in the possession
of the so-called Vicomtesse de Nays. Others were
traced to the Drouillet above mentioned as a possible
thief, and others to Fossard’s brother, a clockmaker
of Paris. Arrests followed, and the clockmaker confessed
that his brother and Drouillet had committed
the robbery and had melted down a portion of the
booty and thrown the rest into the Seine&mdash;where,
as a matter of fact, it was subsequently fished out.
More stolen property was unearthed in the clockmaker’s
cellars.</p>

<p>When the case came up for trial both the Fossards
were sentenced, the elder Etienne, to <i>travaux forc&eacute;s</i>
for life, the younger to ten years. Drouillet was
sentenced to twenty years. Madame de Nays was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
brought to Paris and her domicile searched, but no
fresh proofs of her complicity in the robbery were
forthcoming, and she was released; but it was clear
that her kindness to the young men she patronised
was repaid, both in the shape of information and assistance
in the planning of robberies. A pretty incident
is related of the recovery of these valuable
treasures. A well-known savant who was called in
by the Prefecture to identify them was so overcome
by emotion when he saw them again that he burst
into tears and kissed them repeatedly, especially the
seal of Michael Angelo, the cup of the Ptolemies and
the “Apotheosis of Augustus,” the largest cameo in
the world.</p>

<p>Before leaving Fossard it may be interesting to
note that he had been a long time at large in Paris,
and was the author of innumerable thefts. His
capture was a difficult matter, for he was a reckless
character, who had frequently been sent to the
<i>bagnes</i> and as frequently escaped therefrom. The
police report said of him: “Unequalled for intrepidity
and always armed to the teeth, he must
be attacked with caution.” He declared that he
would blow out the brains of any police agent who
attempted to apprehend him. Vidocq obtained great
credit for making the arrest. Fossard lived in great
retirement at the shop of a vintner, who was secretly
warned by Vidocq that Fossard intended to rob him,
and, if necessary, to cut his throat in doing so. The
vintner, alarmed, was willing enough to admit the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
police, and Fossard was overpowered by the gensdarmes
and taken in his bed. Fossard’s history was
curious. He had embarked early upon a career of
crime. He came of decent people, and had received
a good education, but his nature was vicious and
he speedily lapsed into evil courses. One peculiar
characteristic was useful to him in his nefarious
business. He had a natural taste for the fabrication
of keys, and was known as one of the most skilful
locksmiths of his time. He died at Brest, two or
three years after his conviction of the robbery of
the medals.</p>

<p>Vidocq, with all his shrewdness and insight into
criminal human nature, was himself capable of being
deceived. Later on, when he had secured a firm
foothold in the police and was actually director of
the newly created detective department, a man unknown
to him came to offer his services as an
<i>indicateur</i>. When asked what he could do he answered,
“Anything.” “Well,” said Vidocq, “take
these two five-franc pieces, and bring me the best
two fowls you can find in the market.” The man
returned with the fowls and the money also. “How
did you do it?” asked Vidocq. “I went to the
market,” said the messenger, “carrying the basket
on my shoulders, which I had filled with stones with
straw on the top. I also bought some vegetables,
which were placed on top of the straw. When I
bought the fowls, I begged the woman, as I stood
before her, to place them on the basket; in doing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
this her hands were occupied and mine free, the
pockets of her apron were close in front of me and
I soon recovered my two five-franc pieces and thirty
francs besides.” “That was clever,” cried Vidocq,
“do you often work like that? Come again to-morrow.
I daresay I shall find you a job.” The
would-be agent went off delighted, taking with him
Vidocq’s gold watch and the contents of his pockets.
The thief had made the most of his time, and, while
explaining his action in robbing the woman who
had sold him the fowls, had repeated the trick upon
Vidocq as he stood before him.</p>

<p>Vidocq was no doubt the father of the now
famous French detective police, and its unsavory
origin has been often quoted against it. The authorities
themselves were ashamed of using such
means for the repression of crime, and after ten or
a dozen years Vidocq was dismissed from his employment,
only to resume it, after the Revolution of
1830, in a private and unofficial character, secretly
approved of by the authorities. He still hoped to
return to the Pr&eacute;fecture, and sought to bring it
about by proving his value. One of his agents concerted
with several old convicts to carry out a burglary
in a rich man’s house. Vidocq was able to
give early information, and the police were in a
position to capture the burglars in the act. Such an
arrest brought much credit to Vidocq, who was reinstated
in his old office. But the thieves were in
due course arraigned for trial, and one of them informed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
against Vidocq’s agent, as having suggested
the crime. The judge ordered the arrest of the
agent. Vidocq reported that he had left Paris, and
was not to be found. Again the thieves accused.
The judge now learned that the agent was actually
employed under Vidocq, and the agent was then
taken, tried and sentenced. Vidocq was again discredited,
and the detective office or bureau, now
known as the “Police de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute;,” was re-organised
on a new and perfectly straightforward basis.</p>

<p>The character of Vidocq looms large in the annals
of French crime. His was a strange personality,
and he did some wonderful, although unworthy,
not to say infamous, things. A good picture of
him is preserved by M. Moreau Christophe, long
Inspector General of French prisons. Vidocq, he
tells us, was gifted with extraordinary audacity.
His courage was almost unexampled. He had an
amazing fertility of resource, and was endowed with
remarkable physical strength. He belonged in turn
to the two extremes of society. He might late in
life be called an honest man, but he certainly had
been a thief. His nature was strangely contradictory
and had two sides, both in manners and in conduct.
He was garrulous yet discreet; always a boaster,
yet cunning and secretive. Although prompt to execute,
he was much given to thought before action;
when he seemed to make a chance stroke it was the
result of careful previous calculation. His appearance
was peculiar. Of middle height, but built like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
a small Hercules, he had a large head, carried on
a short, sinewy neck. His yellow hair was thick
and close grown; he had a flat nose, open nostrils
and a large humorous mouth, fleshy cheeks with
salient cheek-bones, small, piercing green eyes,
which glittered under prominent thick eyebrows.
A phrenologist was called in to examine his head
without knowing his name, and reported on his
cranium as combining three types: “that of a liar,
a diplomatist and a sister of charity.” To this M.
Moreau Christophe adds the suggestion that he
would have been better described as “an ape, a fox
and an old humbug.”</p>

<p>Vidocq’s character was despicable, but his underground
methods, exercised for the protection of
society, were largely adopted by the police of the
day. If the ex-thief thief-taker betrayed his old
associates, his action contributed to the reduction
of crime; but there was no such excuse for the
official guardians of law and order who encouraged,
indeed actually manufactured, crime. Men who
had come into power at the Restoration stooped to
support their authority by seeking to prove that
the monarchy was still threatened by conspirators,
eager to re&euml;stablish the fallen r&eacute;gime. Rumors of
dangerous plots were constantly current, and, as
they were mostly insignificant or imaginary, it was
necessary to invent them. For this purpose a
special police was called into existence, known at
the time as the <i>Police provocative</i>. Agents were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
employed to instigate and incite those who were
unguarded in the expression of their Bonapartist
leanings to join in some combination against existing
authority. Traps were laid, sham conspiracies
started and simple folk drawn into them, only to
be betrayed and denounced by the treacherous
agents, who had led them on. Often enough honest
workmen were persuaded, by specious counsels and
unlimited drink, to band themselves together to
overthrow the government; and when committed
beyond explanation or avowal they were arrested
and thrown into gaol. This system of provocation
largely prevailed under the Bourbons. A very
shabby trick was played upon Colonel Caron, who
was concerned in the so-called conspiracy of Colmar.
He had been arrested on suspicion, but was
released and was living quietly at Colmar, when a
secret agent came to him, pretending to be in
trouble with the police for his known political leanings.
Colonel Caron opened his heart to this
traitor, revealed particulars of a plot in progress,
all of which were duly carried to the Prefect, who
gave the agent orders to lead his victim on. A
rising was planned, and everything was ready.
Colonel Caron put on his uniform to head the
conspirators, and when he rode out with cries of
“<i>Vive l’Empereur</i>,” he was arrested by his own
supposed followers, who were agents in disguise.
For this he lost his head, while the police agents
were handsomely rewarded.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>The Saumur conspiracy was similarly fatal to
General Berton. He had long been more than suspected
of heading a conspiracy centred at Saumur,
for the necessary evidence had been gained through
the abominable practice then in force of tampering
with private correspondence in the post. The warrant
for his arrest had been issued, but he saw the
officers approaching from his window and escaped
through a door leading into the garden. The authorities
were determined to take him and sent a
secret agent to hunt him up. The agent ran
into him at length at Thouars, where he was in
hiding with a supposed fellow conspirator, an ex-sergeant
Wolfen, who was in reality another agent
of the police. The general was presently arrested
and tried as a traitor, and in due course suffered
death.</p>

<p>Another case on all fours with these was that
of Colonel La B&eacute;doy&egrave;re, who, to make the story
blacker, was denounced by a police officer under
the greatest obligation to him. This Colonel La
B&eacute;doy&egrave;re was an ardent adherent of the Emperor
Napoleon, whom he had joined on his return from
Elba. He was engaged at Waterloo, and found it
advisable to disappear after the Hundred Days.
He took refuge in the country, and was safely concealed
for some months; but then, in the teeth of
the strong protests of his friends, came back to
Paris, where he was arrested and thrown into the
Conciergerie. Some devoted friends arranged for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
his escape from prison, but they could not see their
way to passing him out of Paris. Release from the
prison was to be effected by buying over an employ&eacute;
with a bribe of 10,000 francs, but the rest was
not easy, and there were no generous English officers
to offer the same help that had been given to
La Valette. When the agent, above mentioned as
being under obligation to La B&eacute;doy&egrave;re, was found,
he promised to see the Colonel safely through the
barrier. When all had been satisfactorily arranged,
the scoundrel went straight to the Prefect, and gave
information, both of the intended escape and the
persons who were to assist in it. Shortly after this
La B&eacute;doy&egrave;re was sentenced to death and was shot,
while the agent received promotion and a considerable
sum as a reward. The sequel is worth telling
as a proof that Nemesis waits on such contemptible
conduct. The man was looked upon with disfavor
even by the police, retired into private life and
became engaged in a commercial undertaking,
which presently failed. His misfortunes deepened.
He was constantly a prey to remorse, and eventually
he took his own life.</p>

<p>Whatever the faults of the system of police
espionage and criminal detection, of which Vidocq
was the first to make systematic use, it was the
premier attempt at anything like a well equipped
detective organisation ever made; and as such it
must be regarded as the foundation of the whole detective
establishment of the police system of to-day.

<span class="medium">THE COMBAT WITH CRIME</span></h2>

<p class="hang">How French justice secures convictions&mdash;Services of spies

<p>French justice has always been open to the reproach
of using unworthy means to arrive at its
end, commendable enough in itself&mdash;the conviction
of the criminal. The services of spies and informers
have always been utilised in a clandestine
fashion. The rule has long obtained, and indeed
is still in force, of employing an agent to insinuate
himself into the confidence of accused persons to
worm out secrets and betray them to the authorities.
The most favorable opportunity is offered by the
intimacy of cell association, and it is seldom that
the spy fails to come upon the secret, however carefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
concealed. The system is still in force, and
has been tried in notable recent cases, such as that
of the truculent and mysterious Campi, the murderer.
The <i>coqueurs</i>, the unofficial attach&eacute;s of the
police, are as old as the hills, and are to be found in
every country; but their ignoble business is perhaps
more widely followed in France than elsewhere.
They are of two classes, those at large and
those in confinement,&mdash;the latter being very generally
found in French prisons. The first class live
with and on the criminal class, in whose operations
they ostensibly take part, so as to gather the knowledge
that makes them useful to the police; but they
are actively engaged in them when they find it safe
and profitable. More often they prefer to inform
and take the reward, but when times are bad they
have been known to invent imaginary schemes and
persuade their friends to undertake them, betraying
the dupes when they were compromised and
fully committed.</p>

<p>The treacherous business of provocation is said
to have been carried further in the troublous times
of the second Revolution. The police were then
directly charged with having invented a serious
disturbance in order to make short work of a number
of political prisoners. In 1832 St. P&eacute;lagie was
full of such prisoners. There was great unrest
within the prison, mutiny was constantly imminent,
and the discontent was encouraged by an absurd
rumor circulated that they were being poisoned by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
the authorities. It was a period of great effervescence
in Paris, for the cholera, then a new and
fearful epidemic, was raging, and the story was
spread that the government was actually propagating
it in order to reduce the number of its political
foes. At last the disturbance came to a head,
and there was a serious outbreak. The prisoners
rose in revolt, smashed the furniture, ill-used their
keepers and by degrees gained possession of the
inner gates. At the same time an insurgent band,
consisting of a couple of hundred Republicans, had
assembled and were bent upon breaking open the
prison to release their friends. It was believed to
be a concerted movement, and was on the point of
success, when the troops arrived. A large body of
the municipal guard advanced, and, dispersing the
crowd, entered the prison, where their attack was
violently resisted. The revolted prisoners were
formally ordered to surrender, but sturdily refused.
The troops felt compelled to open fire, and many
casualties resulted. When peace was restored, the
ringleaders were arrested and removed, and
brought to trial at the Assizes, where many were
sentenced to <i>travaux forc&eacute;s</i>. The authorities were
then charged, as has been said, with having instigated
the disturbance, but no proof of this accusation
was ever produced, and the Prefect of Police
indignantly repudiated the charge.</p>

<img src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The business of the <i>mouton</i> is one of great
danger, and calls for considerable address. Detection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
or even suspicion that a man is so employed
enforces him to vindictive retaliation. He may expect
sooner or later to be roughly handled, probably
murdered. These are the individuals who share the
cell of the accused on purpose and draw him into
conversation and unguarded admissions, which will
be brought in evidence against him, or they help the
judge in his line of interrogatories, the French
method of prosecution. There is a larger class of
<i>moutons</i> known in prisons as the <i>musique</i>, composed
of all who from the moment of arrest are
prepared to confess their evil deeds, name their
associates and reveal their whereabouts and how
they might be taken. Often the <i>musiciens</i> are retained
on the service of the police, and inhabit a
prison for months together, or so long as they
can be useful during a protracted trial.</p>

<p>The baseness of the average <i>mouton</i> is almost
inconceivable. No ties of blood or association are
respected. Brother will denounce brother, a father
his son. Cauler tells a story of a young thief,
who interested him and whom, after receiving much
valuable information from him, he permanently engaged
as a <i>musicien</i>. One day another prisoner
came to the chief of police to give him some facts
about his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The latter had confided
to him that he knew a certain way to effect his escape,
if he could only lay his hands on a substantial
sum of money. “You can get it for me, if you
choose. When you are released go to the banking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
house of Monsieur &mdash;&mdash;. My father is the cashier,
and keeps his safe on the entresol, first door to the
right. He is always alone between four and five
of an afternoon, making up his accounts. Ring the
bell, and when he opens the window say you came
from me, and have a particular message for him.
He will be sure to admit you, and directly you enter
stab him in the heart. You will find his keys in his
inner breast pocket. Open the safe, take out all
the cash, keep half, and let me have the rest when
next we meet.” M. Cauler was greatly horrified,
and sent at once for his <i>musicien</i>, whom he taxed
with this supposed crime. The lad tried to deny it,
but was confronted with his intended accomplice,
and confessed. “Take him away,” cried the indignant
police officer, “never let me see him again.”</p>

<p>Another story is told that may well be placed
along with the above, in proof of the base ingratitude
of which a convict may be guilty. A man had
been sentenced to death, and was awaiting execution
with horror, not so much from dread of the
guillotine as of the disgrace that would fall upon
his family from such a case in its records. A
fellow convict also sentenced to death sought to
console him. “You dread the dishonor of the
public execution,” said he. “I’ll tell you how you
can avoid it, and die in another way.” “Suicide,
do you mean?” “Not at all,” was the reply.
“Listen to me. I have not the smallest hope of a
reprieve; the proofs are overwhelming. Now, no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
one can be executed twice, so I may safely kill as
many people as I choose. I will tell you what I
will do for you. I have a knife concealed in a safe
place, and some night when you are sound asleep,
I will come and make short work of you. It need
not hurt you, for I will do it with one blow.”
Strange to say the man, over whom death hung
with absolute certainty, disliked the idea of losing
his life a day or two before the inevitable time. He
went at once to the governor of the Conciergerie,
where he was lodged at that time, and told the
whole story, saying he went in fear of his life, and
wished to be put in another part of the prison. The
friendly murderer was highly indignant when he
heard of this treachery, and next time a man complained
to him of his impending disgraceful death,
advised him to throw himself over the staircase and
take his own life.</p>

<p>The origin of the word <i>musique</i> may interest the
curious reader. It arose from the practice of collecting
together all the <i>coqueurs</i> and spies having
secret information in a circle, when the recognition
of some unknown new arrival was considered essential.
The latter was then placed in the middle of the
circle, very much as a bandmaster stands when surrounded
by the musicians. An objection to this
custom was that the quality of these informers was
thus revealed, and exposed them all to the vengeance
of their victims and their friends. Strange means
were adopted for circulating the news. The same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
Chenu mentioned above tells us how, when he was
in the exercising yard, a projectile dropped at his
feet, launched by some hand beyond the walls.
When picked up it proved to be a small pellet made
of chewed bread. “<i>Un postillon</i>,” cried someone,
and all gathered round in a group to hear the message,
which was known by that name, contained
in the piece of bread: “Avril, who is now in Bic&ecirc;tre
through the treachery of Lacenaire, wishes all
friends to know.”</p>

<p>The revelations of an ancient comrade served in
a rather remarkable case to bring home a great
crime, which for nearly thirteen years had remained
undiscovered. An old convict, named C&mdash;&mdash;, in 1833,
came to the police, and offered at the price
of 500 francs to give them full information concerning
the murder of the Widow Houet, and to
indicate how the body might still be found. This
murder had occurred in 1821, in the rue Saint
Jacques, and was that of an aged woman of seventy,
possessed of a considerable fortune. She was the
mother of two children, a boy and a girl. The
latter was married to a certain Robert, who had
been a wine merchant, and who was not on the best
of terms with his mother-in-law. One day a
stranger, whose identity was not fixed till much
later, called on the Widow Houet, who was alone,
having sent her servant out some distance. The
visitor after a short parley left, taking the old
woman with him, and she was never seen again.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
After this disappearance suspicion fixed on the son-in-law,
Robert, who was arrested, and with him a
friend named Bastien, who had also been in the wine
trade. Nothing came of the inquiry which followed,
and both the accused men were released. Three
years later they were again arrested on supposed
fresh evidence, but were again released. At last the
man C&mdash;&mdash; came forward with full particulars.
Robert, it appeared, had approached Bastien with
proposals to murder the old woman, whom he hated.
As Robert had never paid over the share promised,
Bastien confided the whole story to C&mdash;&mdash;, and
showed him the copy of a letter he had written his
accomplice, in which were the following words:</p>

<p>“Do not forget the garden of the rue de Vaugirard
81, you know. Fifteen feet from the end wall
and fourteen from the side one. The dead sometimes
come back.” Bastien had carefully preserved
the plan of the garden, on which was marked the
spot where the corpse had been buried. This garden
belonged to an isolated house, which had been
rented by Robert, and Bastien was engaged in digging
a deep pit in it. He bought a cord, provided
himself with quicklime; then one Sunday morning
he called upon the Widow Houet, with a message
from her daughter and son-in-law, that they expected
her to lunch in the new house. Here let
Bastien speak for himself: “The old woman knew
me well as a friend of her children, and accompanied
me in a cart to the rue de Vaugirard. On entering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the garden and reaching a quiet corner, I slipped
my rope round her neck and strangled her. When
certainly dead I buried her, threw in quicklime,
covered up the grave and went to breakfast. There
was one guest short, but Robert asked no questions.
I knew he was satisfied with me. I had done my
part in the business, but he would not perform his,
and never yet has he paid me my price, the half
share of the widow’s fortune. After waiting patiently
all these years and finding him ever after
deaf to my demand and unmindful of my threats, I
resolved to denounce him, through you.”</p>

<p>This was the message brought by C&mdash;&mdash;, and in
response, warrants to arrest the Roberts, man and
wife, were issued by the police. The culprits had
already left Paris, but were followed and brought
back. Meanwhile Bastien was taken into custody
after a hand to hand encounter. He was searched,
and in a pocketbook found upon him were the plan
of the garden and the compromising papers relating
to the Widow Houet’s estate. The case was clear.
Nothing remained but to verify the facts by disinterring
the corpse. It was necessary to proceed with
great caution, lest the body should be removed by
friends of the accused. A watch was set upon the
house now occupied by a master pavier, and his sympathies
were enlisted by warning him that he was to
be the victim of a midnight robbery. He consented
to allow two agents of the police to be stationed in
the garden, and they took post there for several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
nights in succession, but nothing happened. At
last after careful examination the position of the
buried body was fixed by Bastien’s plan, and a party
of diggers from the great cemetery of P&egrave;re La
Chaise came, accompanied by a doctor, to open the
ground. The body of a woman was come upon at
considerable depth, in fair preservation thanks to
the quicklime. The rope was still around her neck,
and she still wore a gold ring. The evidence was
conclusive as to the murder, but the criminals were
allowed the benefit of extenuating circumstances,
and the capital sentence was commuted to <i>travaux
forc&eacute;s</i> for life.</p>

<p>About this same date a murder was committed in
Paris, which will always fill a prominent place in
French criminal records, from the hideous personality
of the principal performer. Few members of
the race of Cain are more widely known than the
bloodthirsty monster, Lacenaire, of whom the saying
is preserved: “I think no more of slaying a man
than of taking a drink of water.” His detection and
delivery to justice were due to the help afforded by
treacherous confederates, who played the <i>musique</i>.
The circumstances, with some account of the central
figure, and the methods pursued, may well find a
place here.</p>

<p>On December 14, 1834, an old woman, the
Widow Chardon, residing in the passage Cheval
Rouge of the rue St. Martin, was brutally done to
death, and her son, who lived with her, was also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
killed. Both had been struck down with the same
hatchet. The state of the premises, locks forced,
furniture smashed, their contents strewed about the
room, showed plainly that robbery had been the
motive of the murder. A fortnight later another
murder was attempted, and was all but successful,
upon a banker’s clerk, who called, in the French
fashion, to collect money on a bill or note of hand,
which had been due, and was payable at the private
address given by the acceptor, by name Mabrossier,
No. 66, rue Montorgueil. The clerk climbed to the
fourth floor, where he found the name Mabrossier
inscribed in white chalk upon the outer door. He
knocked, and was admitted into an empty room,
where two men were evidently awaiting him. The
door was slammed, and he was attacked murderously.
The clerk was young and muscular, and
fought sturdily for his life, uttering such loud cries
for help that the miscreants were alarmed, and fled
down-stairs out of the house.</p>

<p>The only clue to the outrage was the name Mabrossier,
and he was known sufficiently well to the
concierge, who gave a description of him. The
machinery of the police was set in motion, by which
the names of all who pass the night in hotels and
common lodging-houses are inscribed day by day
on the register, and the name Mabrossier was found
finally in a low den kept by one Pageot. Close to it
was another name, Ficellier, recorded the same day,
and the landlord remembered and described his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
visitor. The portrait exactly fitted a certain Fran&ccedil;ois,
at the time in custody, having been arrested
within the last few days for fraud. The landlady,
when pressed, also admitted that Mabrossier had
previously been a lodger under the name of Baton.</p>

<p>The police pieced together the scraps that were
coming to hand. M. Cauler, who was in charge of
the case, openly taxed Fran&ccedil;ois with being Ficellier,
and, on the shrewd suspicion that Baton was Mabrossier,
arrested him, but was forced to release him
for want of more definite evidence. Then a prisoner
in La Force volunteered the fact that Baton
was the intimate of one Gaillard, who sometimes
passed under the name of Baton, but who, in one
of his disguises, corresponded exactly with the much
wanted Mabrossier. The next step was a hunt for
Gaillard, and the name was soon found on another
hotel register. They knew him well, there, and
when asked whether he came often, or had left any
traces, a bundle of songs was produced and a letter,
said to be in his handwriting, containing an offensive
diatribe on the prefect of police. Suddenly a
light broke in on the police. The writing of the
word “Mabrossier,” chalked upon the door in the
house, where the assault was committed, was identically
the same as in this letter.</p>

<p>It was now well known that Gaillard was wanted,
and assistance was offered by another inmate of
La Force, Avril by name, who declared that if let
out for a week he would put Gaillard into the hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
of the police. Nothing came of this boast, and
Avril went back to gaol. Recourse was again had
to Fran&ccedil;ois, who was fetched from the prison to be
interrogated at the Prefecture. In the cab, en route,
Fran&ccedil;ois made a clean breast of everything. He
knew all about the murder of Mother Chardon; he
had heard the whole story from the principal actor,
Gaillard, who had thus a second and more serious
crime to his charge than the attack on the bank
clerk.</p>

<p>Gaillard’s identity was next placed beyond all
doubt. Avril, the same prisoner who had fruitlessly
sought Gaillard through Paris, confided to the police
that the murderer had an aunt of the same name, a
well-to-do person, who lived in great retirement.
A visit was paid to her, and inquiries made as to
her nephew, “Gaillard.” “His real name is Lacenaire,”
she replied, “and I never wish to see or
hear of him again. He is a miscreant, and I constantly
go in fear of my life for him.” So the
search was narrowed down to the real man Lacenaire,
who fortunately was arrested at this very
moment under the name of Levi Jacob, on attempting
to pass a forged bill of exchange. He was
brought at once to Paris, and, when visited in his
cell by the head of the police, readily confessed himself
the author of the crimes, of which he was suspected.
When asked to name his accomplices, he
refused until he heard that both Fran&ccedil;ois and Avril
had informed against him, when he turned upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
them and gave them completely away. They had
betrayed him, and he would not spare them! It
served him right for taking accomplices!</p>

<p>This was the burden of his recital in the many
interviews he had with the police. “Always work
alone, it is the only safe method. Partners and comrades
can never be trusted.” Lacenaire gave many
proofs of this from his own personal experience.
Once at Lyons he was returning home from an
orgie, when he met on the bridge of Morand a well-dressed
gentleman, upon whose white waistcoat
glittered a fat gold chain. The man staggered
slightly, and was clearly under the influence of
drink. They were quite alone together upon the
bridge, and Lacenaire fell upon him, seizing his
throat with one hand and emptying his pockets with
the other. Then, after he had secured the watch
and chain and well-filled pocketbook, he lifted the
victim in his arms and threw him bodily into the
river Rhone, which flowed rapidly beneath. “I
never heard who this man was, nor did I think of
the incident again,” said he. “Having worked
alone, I was never discovered.” Again, when residing
in Paris, just after his release from prison, he
frequented the gaming-house, Palais-Royal, and
watched the lucky players with the idea of following
them in the street to rob and murder them. He
followed a man, who had won 30,000 francs, and,
catching him in a lonely place, threatened him with
his life unless he surrendered at once the contents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
of his pockets. The approach of a passing patrol
frightened Lacenaire, who took to his heels without
the plunder. He escaped because he was alone.
Had he been trammelled with an accomplice they
would probably have got into each other’s way, or
at least Lacenaire would have been obliged to think
of some one beside himself. “Had I not worked
with Avril in the murder of Mother Chardon, he
would never have been able to betray me.”</p>

<p>The life and death of Lacenaire attracted considerable
attention. There was much to interest the
public, albeit unhealthily, in the personal record of
this remarkable criminal, who came of decent
parents, had been well educated, and yet yielded to
the most ignoble passions; who from petty thief
passed through all the phases of commonplace crime
until he threw off all restraint and became a wholesale
murderer. While honest society viewed him
with horror, he became a hero to his fellows, who
would have imitated him had they dared, but were
satisfied to glorify him, to tattoo his name upon their
breasts and to accept him as their chief and model.
He was born in a village near Lyons, and graduated
with honors at the college. Then he went to Paris
and read law. When his father’s failure in business
left him without resources, he enlisted, served for
a time, came back to Paris and soon lapsed into
crime. He could not bear the idea of an empty
pocket, and was ready for any evil deed, that would
fill it. The first committal to prison introduced him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
to friends, by whom he was willingly led astray, and
prepared him for the criminal designs that took
possession of him. When finally tried for his life,
he was no more than thirty-five, and had been guilty
of at least thirty heinous offences. His execution
undoubtedly rid the world of a monster.</p>

<p>Some of the more atrocious and abominable
crimes of French evil-doers will fitly find a passing
reference here. They are mostly characterised by
the traits peculiar to the worst side of the Frenchman,&mdash;of
devilish ingenuity in design, savage resolution
in performance, cynical apathy and indifference
in the face of the forthcoming results, alternating
often with sham emotion and hypocritical grief.
Types re-appear constantly, crimes are repeatedly
reproduced, generation after generation, by criminals
who lack all originality in their actions, generally
inspired by the same motives. The greed for
gold, the craving for sensual self-indulgence, consuming
passion and bitter jealousy and an unappeasable
thirst for revenge, have at all times influenced
the weakly moral sense and accomplished the
most diabolical deeds. In murder cases, the disposal
of the body is one of the chief difficulties that faces
the perpetrator of the crime. It may be possible
sometimes to leave the tell-tale evidence upon the
theatre of the crime, but the danger of detection is
greatly enhanced thereby, and murderers have
therefore usually adopted some other plan of concealing
or removing the corpse. There is nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
new under the sun, and some of these methods of
disposal are to be met with in the earliest criminal
records, and have found imitators down to the present
day. One case may be quoted in which a number
of workmen repairing the Pont de la Concorde
fished a large parcel out of the water, and on opening
it found it contained human remains. The
bundle had been cleverly packed and tied in a common
corn-sack, with an outer cover of packing-cloth.
Shortly afterwards a second parcel, exactly
similar in form and contents, was found at no great
distance from the first. It was presently learned
that a woman named Ferraud, otherwise Renaudin,
who had lived in the street des Egout Saint Martin,
had recently changed her domicile, and had been
helped in the move by a certain L’Huissier, a furniture
maker. Nothing more had been heard of him
until a near neighbor vouchsafed his new address.
L’Huissier was found there, in bed, surrounded by
the effects of the murdered woman. He had let her
an apartment in the same house, and accompanied
her there; had secured her property and promptly
killed her. Then he had made up his parcels, and,
hiring a hand-barrow, wheeled his burden to the
river, to which he consigned it. The case is interesting
as one of the first instances of dismemberment
as a means of disposal.</p>

<p>Forty years later human remains were found in
the bedroom of a hotel in the rue de Poliveau, and
were presently discovered to be those of a milkwoman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
who employed Barr&eacute;, a notary’s clerk, who
concerned himself with the investments of any one
who would trust him. The milkwoman was one of
the number. She had come to Barr&eacute;’s rooms to
charge him with the sale of certain scrip, but was
murdered when off her guard. Other similar cases
were those of the “Woman of Clichy,” whose husband
murdered her and buried her on the banks of
the Seine. The criminal here was an old soldier,
wearing the military medal, and nicknamed the
“decor&eacute;.” A third case was that of Pr&eacute;vost, a
police sergeant, who had killed a tailor’s traveller,
who had called upon him in the hopes of disposing
of some of his stock. When arrested and brought to
trial it was proved that this was the second murder
of which Pr&eacute;vost had been guilty. His first victim
had been a housekeeper to a gentleman, who had
made her his heir. She desired to buy the good-will
of a small business, and consulted Pr&eacute;vost, at
whose advice she realised part of her property, and
brought it to him to complete the purchase. She
dined with Pr&eacute;vost, having the money in her pocket,
and was put out of the way that he might secure it.</p>

<p>The most famous case of all is one of the most
recent, and made the reputation of M. Mac&eacute;, the
well-known chief of the French detective police.
Here a suspicious parcel had been found in a well in
the centre of an apartment house. A second parcel
was presently recovered, with identical contents.
Both parcels were tied up in black glazed calico, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
ends of both were knotted in a peculiar way, and
both were stitched with black cotton. These facts
threw suspicion upon some journeyman tailor. It
was soon discovered that an inmate of the apartment
house, who was a working sempstress, received
the visits of a tailor, who brought her work. Attention
was thus directed to this man Voirbo. His
antecedents were investigated, and it was found that
an aged man, a miser with means, often in Voirbo’s
company, had disappeared. The crowning point in
this case was the cleverness shown by M. Mac&eacute; in
discovering that the dismemberment had taken place
in Voirbo’s own rooms. The tiled floor in the living
room sloped in one direction, and M. Mac&eacute;, readily
judging that if a body had been disposed of in the
room, the blood would have flowed that way, at once
emptied a decanter upon the floor. The running
water led him to a spot under which, when laid bare,
a quantity of dark matter, proved later to be dry
human blood, was disinterred. Voirbo was challenged
with the crime, and confessed, but before
execution committed suicide.</p>

<p>Crimes of the character indicated above are
numerous enough in the criminal annals of France,
but they by no means constitute the whole of her
calendar of crime; and in the next chapter we pass
on to others not less fearsome.

justice in this case one of the supposed causes of the French
Revolution of 1848.</p>

<p>The crime of parricide was so little conceivable
in ancient law that no mention of it appears in the
early codes. Six centuries of civilisation elapsed
before the Roman law-makers devised a special
penalty for the child who slew his parent. The
guilty offspring was sewn up in a leather sack, and
drowned in the sea; in this it was the custom later
to enclose a dog, a cock, a viper and a monkey. The
case of Benoit, quoted below, was by no means
isolated. At the trial of Edward Donon Cadot in
1844, the public prosecutor admitted that there had
been ninety-five parricides in France in the course
of ten years. Only a short time before had the
special penalty inflicted in addition to death, that
of mutilation by striking off the offending hand,
been suppressed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>The causes that have inspired this horrible offence
are in all cases generally the same; either the impatient
heirs, weary of waiting for their inheritance,
have hastened the departure of the obstacle,
or they have resented the duties imposed on them
by the prolonged existence of an aged and useless
parent. These reasons have too often weighed in
France, especially with the peasant class, at once
avaricious and greedy, and the most hideous stories
of the savage cruelty of children towards their
parents are to be found in French criminal records;
and this even in quite recent times.</p>

<p>A singularly savage instance of matricide is on
record; that of Frederick Benoit, who murdered his
mother at Vouziers, in 1832, and committed a certain
murder at Versailles, for which he suffered
death in Paris. This Benoit was the third son of
the Justice of the Peace at Vouziers. The father
was in the habit of visiting a mill he owned at some
little distance, and passing the night there. Madame
Benoit, when left alone, was always a prey to apprehension,
for they kept a considerable sum in cash in
the wardrobe, near her bedroom. This fact was
known to young Benoit. One night, when the judge
was absent, an alarm of robbers was raised, and
several neighbors rushed in. Frederick met them
on the threshold with the news that the thieves had
escaped by the window, but he begged some one
to rouse his mother at once. On entering her room
she was found lying dead upon her bed, with her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
throat cut from ear to ear. Death must have
been instantaneous, but her head was enveloped
in a woollen petticoat, undoubtedly to stifle her
cries.</p>

<p>Circumstance did not support the theory that
thieves had broken into the house. All the windows
had been securely closed at bedtime. The shutters
could be opened only from within. Besides there
were no signs of muddy footmarks brought in from
outside, where it was raining hard. Nor, last of
all, was the existence of the money in the cupboard,
6,000 francs in gold, known to any one outside the
family circle. The inquiry seemed naturally limited,
therefore, to the persons actually occupying the
house that night,&mdash;Frederick Benoit and a young
girl, a cousin, who served as domestic. As the boy
was barely twenty and the girl not seventeen, the
police could not bring themselves to suspect them.
Several arrests were made, but guilt could not be
fixed upon any one. Then all at once the second
murder was committed by Benoit, who killed a
youthful companion, with whom he was on the most
intimate terms. They had occupied a room together
in a small hotel at Versailles. At midday Benoit
had gone out, but no sign was made by the other.
In the evening, about 7 o’clock, the servants went up
and found the door locked from the outside. They
entered by another door, and discovered the body of
the second young man with his throat cut. “Precisely
as my mother was killed,” remarked Benoit,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
when subsequently arrested, and brought into the
presence of the body at the Morgue.</p>

<p>Witnesses now appeared, who had heard the deceased
declare that his life was in danger from Frederick
Benoit. “I know what he has done, and he
will certainly kill me some day to save his own
skin.” Benoit was accordingly arrested. A search
in his lodgings in Paris revealed a razor case, from
which the razor had been removed, and a quantity
of gold inserted, wrapped up as <i>rouleaux</i> in fragments
of the <i>Constitutionnel</i> newspaper, to which
his father, the judge, was a subscriber. Further
incriminating evidence now came from the last confession
of the girl Louise Feucher, his cousin, to
the effect that she had been his accomplice in the
murder of Madame Benoit. She had fled from the
house in Vouziers to Paris, and fallen into bad
ways, which had led to her imprisonment in Les
Magdelonnettes, where she entered the hospital, and
died.</p>

<p>Frederick Benoit was duly convicted, sentenced
to death and executed. It came out in the course
of the trial that his mother had had a strong presentiment
of impending evil. On the night of the
murder, when her husband was absent, she carefully
inspected the house with her son, the intending
parricide, and made all secure. “The nights are
long (it was the month of November); we never
know what might happen,” she said, closing all
doors and shutters, and looking to the locks and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
fastenings. She could not protect herself from the
danger already within the house. Her murderer
was in a room close by, and he accomplished his
purpose with a single blow, while she still slept, and
passed, without a struggle, instantaneously from
life to death.</p>

<p>M. Donon Cadot, a prosperous banker of Pontoise,
was found murdered in his offices on January
15, 1844; and suspicion fell upon his second son,
who lived with him. He was a widower. His
household was limited to one general servant, and
his economy was so rigid that he passed for a miser.
No doubt he was very illiberal to his son. On the
day named, one for the settlement of bills and notes
of hand, the banker was at his desk by 9 o’clock,
ready to meet his engagements, and transacted business
for a time, but at the half hour the doors were
found closed, and the son, answering for his father,
declared that he had been called away for a time.
He had not returned by four in the afternoon, and
the son on the premises, Edward, summoned an
elder brother, who lived in the town, to attend to
the business of the bank. Together they found a
sluggish stream of mingled blood and ink, flowing
under the office door. Forcing it they discovered
the lifeless corpse of their father within. He had
been battered to death by some heavy instrument.</p>

<p>The motive of the crime was revealed by the
forced safe and empty drawers of the desk. Everything
of value, bills, bank-notes, cash and a quantity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
of plate had been carried off. The first named,
many hundred in number, and amounting in all to
some 300,000 francs, being unnegotiable, were returned
by post. Other bills, however, were presented,
and the bearer of one of them was traced to
his home, where a number of the papers were found
in the same handwriting as the envelopes which had
come through the post. This fixed the suspicion on
a man named Rousselot, and he was brought to confess
that he had participated in the crime. He had
committed it at the instigation of the son Edward,
who was moved by greed and jealousy. A long
trial followed, resulting in the conviction of Rousselot
and a sentence of life at the galleys, but the evidence
was not deemed conclusive against the son,
and he was released.</p>

<p>A common feature in French crime has always
been the systematic organisation of offenders in
bands, where a number of them contrive to act in
concert under chosen leaders. There have been
many of these associations from time to time working
on a wide scale and doing enormous damage.
The <i>chauffeurs</i>, so called from their methods of torture
to extort confessions of hidden wealth, were a
product of the revolutionary epoch, and a revival
of the baneful bands, that have constantly ravaged
France from the Middle Ages. The extensive operations
of Cartouche, one of the most daring and
successful of thieves on a large scale, were rivalled
by the terrible band directed by Hulin in the forest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of Montargis, and the exploits of Pontailler, who
worked close up to the walls of Paris.</p>

<p>The depredations of a number of the worst criminals
spread terror through the capital in 1836 and
the years immediately following. Now again, as
when Vidocq was charged with pursuit and discovery,
serious robberies were of constant occurrence,
and were rightly attributed to associated action.
Very many ex-convicts, those regularly released,
and yet more who had made their escape from durance,
were at large. Some five or six thousand infested
Paris alone. The police were ever on the
alert, but failed to put their hands upon the ringleader,
until all at once an atrocious murder was
committed in broad daylight in the populous quarter
of the Temple.</p>

<p>Among the respectable dealers of that neighborhood
was a family named Renaud, father, mother
and daughter, who kept a shop for the sale of mattresses
and bedding. One afternoon in June, Renaud
meant to take his wife and daughter for a walk,
and sent the girl to their private residence, hard by,
to help her mother to dress. She found the rooms
securely locked, and, thinking her mother was
within, asleep, went down to ask her father if she
should be awakened. On her return she met a man
coming down in a hurry, and a second, following.
But still her mother’s door was closed. Still no
answer came to her knocking, and she again sought
her father, who now ascended and broke into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
room with a hatchet. Madame Renaud was lying
dead upon the floor, bearing many wounds. It was
subsequently found that a bag of gold had been
abstracted from the room, a quantity of silver
money and several pieces of plate. Beyond question
the strange men first seen were the authors of
the crime. As the men reached the street a woman
had met them, and heard a sound of silver rattling
down on the pavement. Some one also cried after
them: “Here! You’ve dropped a silver spoon;”
and the smaller of the two paused to pick it up and
run on. Others noted them as they passed, and that
their clothes were much stained with blood. But
they went on, and entered a caf&eacute;, where they called
for two glasses of sugared water. Their haggard
looks attracted attention, and they were seen using
the water bottle to wash their hands below the
table. Evidently disturbed, and dreading further
observation, they got up and hurriedly left the caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>The description given of these two men fitted
with that of a couple of convicts recently released
from Toulon. Search was made for them, and, as
it progressed, the police came upon several confederates,
all members of a gang in which these two,
by name Soufflard and Le Sage, were leading
spirits. With a third, called Micaud, they formed
the executive of this criminal association. They
had all been at Toulon together, and were known
there as the most violent and intractable prisoners.
When a new act of insubordination was planned,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
a new series of thefts, this trio always originated
or were concerned in it. Le Sage in particular was
a terror to his keepers. He had a sister of the same
type as himself, a half savage peasant woman, who
hawked bread about in a basket, but whose real
occupation was that of spy, who hunted out jobs
for execution, promising great profit to those who
could bring them off. She had trained a small son
to assist her, a precocious child, who was an adroit
thief on his own account. Inspired and guided by
these chiefs, a number of lesser practitioners were
kept constantly busy. Crimes multiplied throughout
Paris; jewellers’ shops were broken into, and
private apartments by force or with false keys;
shops were explored by pretended purchasers of
goods, and their weak points laid bare and a descent
made next night.</p>

<p>Le Sage, who had been locked up for a brief space
in La Force, was, on his release, informed by his
sister of the chances offered by the Renaud establishment
in the Temple. He saw at once that robbery
could hardly be effected without violence, which
he did not shrink from, but he wanted a stalwart
companion. Soufflard, who was also at large, was
thirsting for some “big thing,” and willingly joined
in the attack upon the Renauds. The crime once
committed, the police were soon on the track of the
murderers, guided by the indications of false friends.
Le Sage was taken first, and easily identified.
Soufflard, who had three separate domiciles, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
was very wary, was only caught through the help of
a jealous comrade, who denounced him. Trial and
conviction rapidly followed, but Soufflard after the
sentence, evading the supervision of the warders,
who were removing him to the Conciergerie, swallowed
a quantity of arsenic, and died of the effects.
Le Sage also committed suicide by hanging himself
in his cell.</p>

<p>Crime is of no class, and in all countries and in
all ages, high born offenders, as well as low, have
stood in the dock to answer for their misdeeds.
There are two cases about this period that may be
quoted here in proof of this particular statement;
one the alleged poisoning of her husband by
Madame Lafarge; the other, the horrible murder
of the Duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin by her husband,
the Duke, at their mansion, the Hotel Sebastiani
in the Faubourg St. Honor&eacute;, Paris. Both take rank
with the most celebrated cases, and attracted extraordinary
interest, which has but little abated even
now.</p>

<p>The case of Madame Lafarge is still an unsolved
mystery. Grave doubts as to her guilt prevailed,
and many learned lawyers have maintained that she
was the victim of judicial error. The accused, Marie
Fortun&eacute;e Cappelle, was a young lady in good society,
well educated and well bred, who had married a
manufacturer at Glandier in the Limoges country,
not far from Bordeaux. She was the daughter of a
colonel in Napoleon’s Artillery of the Guard. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
was well connected. Her aunts were well married,
one to a Prussian diplomatist, the other to Monsieur
Garat, the General Secretary of the Bank of France.
Her father had stood well with Napoleon, had held
several important military commands, and was intimate
with many of the nobles of the First Empire.
Marie lost her parents early, and, being possessed
of a certain fortune, a marriage was sought for her
in the usual French way. She was not exactly
pretty, but was distinguished looking, with a slim,
graceful figure, a dead white complexion, jet black
eyes and a sweet, sad smile.</p>

<p>The husband chosen was a certain Charles Pouch
Lafarge, a man of fair position, but decidedly the
inferior of Marie Cappelle. He was in business as
an iron master, and was deemed prosperous. He
said he had a large private residence in the neighborhood
of his works, a fine mansion, situated in a wide
park, where his wife would be in the midst of agreeable
and fashionable society. Great, almost indecent,
haste was shown in arranging and solemnising
the marriage. Within five days the bride started
for her new home, and quickly realised that she had
been completely befooled. M. Lafarge at once
showed himself in his true colors as a rough, brutal
creature, who treated his wife badly from the first.
The family seat at Glandier was a fraud. It was a
damp, dark house in a street, surrounded with
smoky chimneys. The park did not exist, nor did
the pleasant neighbors. She had been grossly deceived,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
and the reality was even worse than it appeared,
for Lafarge was in serious financial difficulties,
and had been obliged to issue forged bills
of exchange to keep his head above water. The
unhappy and disappointed wife, when face to face
with the truth, made a determined effort to break
loose from Lafarge. On the very day of her arrival
at Glandier, she shut herself up in her room, and
wrote him an indignant yet appealing letter, in
which she threatened, if he would not let her go,
to take arsenic. And this, her first mention of the
lethal drug, was remembered against her in later
days, when she was tried for her life.</p>

<p>Peace was patched up between the ill-assorted
couple, and Marie was persuaded to withdraw her
letter and promise to do her best to accept the position,
and make her husband happy. “With a little
strength of mind,” she wrote to an uncle, “with
patience and my husband’s love, I may grow contented.
Charles adores me, and I cannot but be
touched by the caresses he lavishes on me.” He
must have been willing enough to secure her good
graces, for he wanted her to part with her fortune
to improve his business. He had discovered a new
process in iron-smelting, which promised to be
profitable, and his wife lent him money to develop
the invention. Then he hurried to Paris to secure
the patent, and while absent from Glandier, where
his wife remained, the first event occurred on which
the suspicion of foul play was based. Madame Lafarge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
was now so affectionately disposed that she
desired to send her portrait to her husband. The
picture was to be accompanied by a number of small
cakes prepared by the mother-in-law, and Marie
Lafarge wrote to beg her husband to eat one at a
particular hour on a particular day. She would do
the same at Glandier, and thereby set up some mysterious
<i>rapport</i> with her husband. When the parcel
arrived, the picture was found within, but no small
cakes, only one large one. The box had been tampered
with. When it left Glandier, it was screwed
down. It reached Paris fastened with long nails.
Lafarge, on opening it, broke off a part of the large
cake, and ate it. That night he was taken violently
ill. The cake presumably contained poison, but the
fact was never proved, still less that Marie Lafarge
had inserted the arsenic, which it was supposed to
contain. The evidence against her was that she
had bought some of this baneful drug from a chemist
at Glandier. The charge was definitely made, but
on weak evidence, the chief being the purchased
arsenic and her manifest agitation when the news
came from Paris that her husband had been taken ill.
On the other hand, there was nothing to show that
she had substituted the large poisoned cake for the
small ones, or that no one else had handled the
parcel. Here crept in the notion of another agency,
and the suggestion that some one else might have
been anxious to poison Lafarge. This idea was by
no means extravagant, and it cropped up more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
once during the proceedings, but no proper attention
was paid to it. Had the clue been followed, it might
have led inquiry to the possible guilt of another
person.</p>

<p>Lafarge returned from Paris a good deal shaken,
but the doctor promised that with rest his health
would be restored. On the contrary it got worse,
and with symptoms which to-day would undoubtedly
be attributed to arsenical poisoning. Marie
Lafarge would have constituted herself sole nurse,
but the mother-in-law would not agree, and would
never leave her alone with her husband. Witnesses
deposed to having seen Marie take a white powder
from a cupboard, which she mixed with the chicken
broth and medicine given to Lafarge. Another
witness declared that the patient cried out “that
his medicine burnt out like fire.”</p>

<p>All this time Marie Lafarge did not conceal her
possession of arsenic. She bought it openly to kill
rats, she said: a very hackneyed excuse. It had
been bought through one of Lafarge’s clerks, Denis
Barbier by name, upon whom rested strong suspicion
from first to last. Barbier was a man of bad
character, passing under a false name. He had been
the secret accomplice of Lafarge in passing forged
bills, and a shrewd theory was advanced that all
along he was scheming to supplant his master and
take possession of his property after he (Lafarge)
had been made away with. Barbier’s conduct was
such that the Prussian jurists who investigated the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
trial afterwards declared that they would have accused
him of the crime rather than Madame Lafarge.</p>

<p>The trial was no doubt conducted with gross carelessness.
A post-mortem was made, but not until
it was insisted upon, and it was very imperfectly
performed. When at length the corpse was disinterred,
only an infinitesimal quantity of arsenic was
at first found in the remains, but when the most
eminent scientists of the day were called in, it was
established by M. Orfila that the deceased had been
poisoned. The circumstances of the case fixed the
guilt upon Madame Lafarge. She was very ably
defended by the famous Maitre Lachaud, but the
jury had no doubt, and condemned her by a majority
of voices. At the same time she was given the
benefit of extenuating circumstances, and sentenced
to <i>travaux forc&eacute;s</i> for life, with exposure in the public
square of Tulle. This decision, although supported
by science, was not universally approved.
Many believed in her innocence to the last, and the
number of her sympathisers was legion. She endured
her imprisonment at Montpelier, where she
remained for many years, engaged almost continually
in literary work. Her “Memoirs” and a
work entitled “Prison Hours” were largely read.
She also conducted an enormous correspondence,
for she was permitted to receive and send out an
unlimited number of letters. No less than six thousand
passed through her hands. At length in 1852
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
she petitioned the head of the State, and was released
with a full pardon by Napoleon III.</p>

<p>It is impossible at this length of time to settle a
question so keenly debated by her contemporaries.
The possibility of her having served for another’s
crime hardly rests on any very strong basis, and the
circumstances that led to her arraignment were very
much against her. It must not be forgotten, moreover,
that she was charged with a crime other than
that of theft, and was convicted of it. In this again
she may have suffered unjustly. A school friend,
who had become the wife of the Vicomte de Leautaud,
accused her of having stolen her diamonds,
when on a visit at her house. Marie Lafarge freely
admitted the diamonds were in her possession, and
pointed out where they might be found at Glandier,
but she refuted the accusation of theft, and declared
that the Vicomtesse had entrusted the diamonds to
her to be sold. Her former lover threatened blackmail,
and Madame de Leautaud was driven to buy
him off&mdash;this was Marie’s explanation, which
Madame de Leautaud repelled by declaring that it
was Marie Lafarge who was threatened, and that
the diamonds were to be sacrificed to save her good
name. In the end, the case was tried in open court,
and Madame Lafarge was found guilty, although
there were many contradictory facts. It was strange
that the Vicomtesse so long refrained from complaining
of the theft, and made so little of the loss.
Marie, on the other hand, scarcely secreted the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
jewels, and was known to have a number of fine
loose stones, for which she variously accounted&mdash;one
story being that they were a gift, another that
she had owned them from childhood. A sentence
of two years’ imprisonment was passed upon Madame
Lafarge, but it merged in the larger term,
when she was convicted of having poisoned her
husband.</p>

<p>The murder of the Duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin
by the husband shocked all Europe, not only on
account of the horrible details of the deed, but from
the high rank of the parties concerned. The Duke
held his head high as the representative of an ancient
family, and his unhappy victim was one of
the leaders of French fashionable society. She was
the daughter of one of the first Napoleon’s famous
generals, the Count Sebastian, and when in Paris
they resided at the Sebastian Hotel in the Faubourg
St. Honor&eacute;, in the Champs Elys&eacute;es. In August,
1840, the family came from their country seat,
the magnificent Chateau of Vaux, constructed by
the famous Fouquet, Louis XIV’s finance minister,
who fell into such irretrievable disgrace, and died
after long years of close imprisonment.</p>

<p>It was not a happy marriage, although ten children
had been born to them. But the Duke and
Duchess had become estranged as the years passed
by, and were practically separated. Although still
residing under the same roof, they held no communication
with each other. What is now called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
incompatibility of temper was the cause, and the
Duke was a masterful, overbearing man, who
wanted his own way, and had his own ideas as to
the bringing up of his children. He would not suffer
his wife to have any voice in their education and
management, but claimed to control them completely
through their governesses, who were quickly
changed if they failed to give satisfaction. One at
last was found to suit, and the fact served to suggest
a motive for the crime. Whether or not there was
really an intrigue between this Madame Deluzy
and the Duke, it was strongly suspected, and the
Duchess certainly detested her. The Duke put the
governess in a false position. He preferred her
society, and lived much with his children committed
to her charge, in a remote wing of the house.</p>

<p>These relations continued unchanged for several
years, and the Duchess, although consumed with
jealous rage, would have ended them by pleading
for a divorce. Here the King and Queen intervened,
and sought to reconcile husband and wife.
Madame Deluzy left the Praslins to take a situation
at a school, the head of which, not strangely,
asked for a personal character from the Duchess.
Curious stories had been put about, which must be
cleared up before the new governess could be engaged.
The Duchess refused pointblank to give a
certificate, although the mistress came in person
with Madame Deluzy to seek it. No doubt the
Duke took this refusal in very bad part, and it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
believed a violent quarrel ensued, although no record
of it was preserved. But it is a fact of the
utmost importance as supplying the motive for the
crime committed the same night, or rather in the
small hours of the following morning.</p>

<p>At four o’clock agonized cries disturbed the sleeping
household. They proceeded from the Duchess’s
apartment, and were compared by those who heard
them to the yells of a lunatic in a fit of fury. Frantic
ringings of the bell, rapid and intermittent, were
the next sounds, followed by deep groans, the thud
of blows and the fall of a heavy body. The servants
rushed down, and found an entrance through
doors, which had been locked from within. All the
external doors and shutters giving upon the gardens
were closed, their fastenings intact; only that of an
antechamber, leading to the staircase which communicated
with the Duke’s bedroom on the floor
above, was open. He was apparently still undisturbed,
and it was not until the servants had penetrated
to the inner apartment, where they found the
Duchess lying prone in her nightdress and deluged
with blood, that the Duke appeared on the staircase.
He was greatly agitated, asked excitedly and repeatedly
what had happened, and struck the wall
and his head with his hands. When he saw the
corpse he cried: “Who can have done this? Help!
Help! Fetch a doctor. Quick!”</p>

<p>The doctors arrived, and close behind them the
commissaries of police, who began their investigation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
immediately. That murder had been committed
was clear from the slashed and stricken state of the
corpse. There were quite a dozen wounds. The
throat was cut down to the bone, the carotid artery
and the jugular severed. Gashes in the hands
showed that desperate attempts had been made to
ward off the murderous blows by catching at the
blade of the knife used. The poor woman had
fought a hard fight for her life. Later, a close examination
of the Duke proved that he had been
wounded. His left hand was lacerated, and the
thumb had been bitten, deep scratches with nails convulsively
used,&mdash;all these bore witness to the struggle,
and turned suspicion to the Duke. This was
strengthened by other telltale facts. His bedroom
was in the utmost disorder, water had been poured
into the basin to wash off traces of blood, and several
garments wringing wet were hung up in the
place.</p>

<p>When called upon to state the facts as he knew
them, the Duke made a very lame defence. He had
roused from a sound sleep by loud cries, but, believing
they came from the street outside, he waited
until he thought he heard steps in the garden; then
he rose, put on a dressing-gown, took a loaded pistol,
and went down to his wife’s room. He called
to her, but received no answer, and then lit a candle,
by the feeble light of which he discovered her where
she lay bleeding to death. Overcome with horror,
he said, he ran back to his own room to wash off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
the blood with which he was now covered, and again
descended to join the servants, who had now arrived
upon the scene. The replies to the many serious
questions put to the Duke were considered
highly incriminating, and as by this time the highest
officers of justice had reached the spot it was
decided that the supposed murderer, whose guilt
seemed clear, should be taken into custody. The
King (Louis Philippe) was absent at his seaside
residence, the Castle of Eu, and a special messenger
was despatched to the coast, asking that the House
of Peers should be summoned as a high court of
justice to deal with the crime.</p>

<p>Meanwhile an order of arrest was issued, and the
Duke would have been conveyed to the nearest
prison but that a disturbance was dreaded. Great
crowds had assembled near the Hotel Sebastian, and
feeling ran high against the aristocratic criminal.
A day was thus wasted, and when the Duke was
removed at length to the Luxembourg lock-up he
was too weak to walk, and could barely speak. It
was thought at first that he had been attacked with
cholera; for that dread epidemic was just then ravaging
Paris, and he exhibited some of the symptoms
of that disease; but there was presently little doubt
that when left unobserved in his own house he had
contrived to become possessed of some poison, and
had attempted his own life. When searched, on
leaving his house, a phial was found in his pocket,
containing laudanum mixed with arsenical acid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Remedies were promptly applied, but failed to counteract
the evil effects of the strong dose.</p>

<p>The “instruction,” or preliminary inquiry, was,
however, continued, despite the condition of the accused
and the constitutional difficulties which demanded
the intervention of the House of Peers.
But the Duke grew weaker hourly, and could frame
no replies to the questions, and was beyond doubt
dying. At the last, just three days after his commission
of the crime, he made full confession of
his guilt. Nothing had been proved against Madame
Deluzy. She had been charged with complicity,
but was in due course discharged.</p>

<p>The crime of De Choiseul-Praslin occurred at a
time when political passion ran high, and the reign
of Louis Philippe was approaching its term. The
feeling against the aristocracy was greatly embittered;
the republican opposition was strongly
moved by this atrocious murder committed by a
Duke and Peer of France upon an unoffending wife.
A report gained ground and could not be discredited,
that the authorities had permitted him to evade
justice; that the story of his death was quite untrue,
and that he had been allowed to escape to England.
There were people who afterwards declared
that they had met the Duke, walking with Madame
Deluzy in a London street, and when the funeral
took place an attack was threatened upon the hearse
so as to verify the matter. All this increased the
popular excitement, and the government was fiercely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
denounced for daring to shield a titled criminal from
the consequence of his acts. No doubt the Praslin
murder was a contributory cause of the Revolution
of 1848 and the downfall of Louis Philippe.

<p>He of whom the law falls foul in Paris finds himself
in due course at the depot or prison of the Prefecture.
This has been called the universal prison,
for it is the portal through which all offenders, all
actual or suspected law breakers, must necessarily
pass. It receives, examines, rejects and releases, or
commits for further proceedings, a whole world of
people. The continuous stream passing in and out
includes all classes, men and women, old and young,
the healthy and the infirm, Parisian and provincial,
natives and foreigners of nearly all nationalities.
It has well been called a place of deposit, in which
all are impounded who have gone astray under suspicious
circumstances. Every one is brought here,&mdash;the
criminal and the degenerate; the luckless and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
the unfortunate; the vagabond, the lost or abandoned,
the weakminded and the unprotected. Three
times in every twenty-four hours, the cellular omnibuses
lodge all they find in their rounds of the
sub-police stations, the <i>violons</i>, so called from the
well-known musical instrument, and also from an
instrument by which prisoners’ feet are bound.</p>

<p>The process of arrest and treatment at the <i>violon</i>
has been graphically described by one who has been
through it. “As soon as my name had been inscribed
on the register, the brigadier in charge
promptly ordered me to empty my pockets, and not
to forget anything. After this, to make quite sure,
I was personally searched, and everything of value,
and much that was not, was taken from me;
my collar, my necktie, one cigar, my penknife,
watch, purse and even my braces, were all put into
my pocket handkerchief and tied up. As they were
taking me away to the cell I begged that my braces
and pocket handkerchief might be returned. The
rude answer was, ‘You must hold up your trousers
with your hand, and blow your nose as best you
can. That’s enough;’ and I was very summarily
locked up in one of three cells at the end of the
passage; a dirty looking place, smelling like a rabbit
hole, and already occupied by a ragged creature,
who immediately demanded tobacco; and, on my
saying I had none, asked me to stand treat for some
food as he had not eaten since the day before. I
ordered this out of compassion, and he devoured it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
voraciously, then went soundly to sleep upon the
wooden guard bed. It was bitterly cold, and
towards morning my companion, saying that he was
half frozen, battered at the door, and asked permission
to go out into the large room and warm himself
by the stove, a privilege accorded to me also.</p>

<p>“At an early hour the omnibus came, and I was
taken to the depot, where I was registered in the
outer office, and then passed in to undergo the ordeal
of the <i>petit parquet</i>, where I was subjected to the
interrogations of one of the substitutes of the Procureur
of the Republic. The work is done quickly.
Time presses. There are many cases to be examined
and disposed of.”</p>

<p>The plan of procedure is the same for all. Where
the offence is venial the culprit is speedily set at
large. Others whose guilt is clearly proved, or
who make a clean breast of it, are passed on without
a moment’s delay to the correctional police. It
is only for those who are charged with grave crimes,
with robbery, forgery, murderous assaults, and
the like; whose cases are surrounded with doubt,
or who obstinately refuse to confess, that the whole
machinery of the French law is set in motion. The
accused is then handed over to the tender mercies
of one of the <i>juges d’instruction</i>, in order that, at
all costs, the ends of justice may be assured. The
examination was conducted until recently in a manner
abhorrent to all ideas of fair play. It is the
rule in a free country that no man need incriminate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
himself. In France the accused was fully expected
to do so. He was, indeed, forced into it if he would
not do it of his own accord. Under the system
which prevailed till quite recently the judge in turn
cajoled, beguiled and hectored the accused. He
set pitfalls and wove snares; he repeated his questions
in a dozen different forms; he had recourse
to <i>coups de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>, and openly produced the <i>pi&eacute;ces
de convictions</i>, the weapons used in a murder to
confront a supposed criminal, or brought him face
to face with the reeking and revolting remains of
the victim. Sometimes judge and accused were
fairly matched, and there was as much fence and
finesse, as much patient cunning and persistency on
the one side as on the other. Sometimes the moral
torture was more than the prisoner could bear, and
he abandoned his defence. It is of record that a
murderer, maddened by the assiduity of the interrogating
judge, cried suddenly: “Yes, I did it. I
can deny it no longer. I’d rather be guillotined
than be bullied like this.” But in most cases the
process of investigation ordinarily extended over
many days. The prisoner was brought up again
and again before he was finally arraigned. Even
then there was a further delay before he was convicted
and received sentence. All this time he spent
at Mazas, the old <i>maison d’arr&ecirc;t cellulaire</i>. He
now goes, after sentence, to Fresnes, on the outskirts
of Paris, the imposing prison recently erected
to replace Mazas.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>But Mazas had a history. It was associated with
the chief criminality of Paris for more than half
a century, and a detailed account of it should be
preserved. It was the first tardy effort of the
French to follow in the path of prison reform, and
was first opened on the nineteenth of May, 1850,
to receive the seven hundred inmates of the then
condemned La Force. Elsewhere prisons and their
inmates had occupied a large share of public attention
in the first half of the nineteenth century. The
United States led the way with plans of amelioration,
and the prisons of Auburn and Sing-Sing
were conspicuous examples of the new order of
things. In England, Millbank Penitentiary had
been erected regardless of cost, after a scheme originated
by John Howard and Jeremy Bentham, and
had given place after thirty years of experiment
to Pentonville, built under the auspices and personal
supervision of some of the most distinguished
Englishmen of the day. France alone lagged behind.
The question was discussed there, but little
more than talking was done. Two eminent publicists,
MM. Beaumont and De Tocqueville, had
visited America in 1837, and published a valuable
monograph upon the penitentiaries of the United
States. In 1840, an energetic and philanthropic
prefect of Paris, Gabriel Delessert, converted, by
his own authority, the boys’ prison of La Petite
Roquette into a place of cellular confinement. Still,
it was not till 1844 that the principle of isolation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
and separation for all prisoners was accepted even
theoretically, in France. Five years more elapsed
before Mazas, the first French prison built in accordance
with modern ideas was ready for the
reception of prisoners.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that, although French prison
administrators were slow to put their hands to the
work, when once it was undertaken they did their
best to make the new establishment a success. The
best models of the time were adopted and closely
followed. The architect of Mazas, if he did not
exactly imitate Sir Joshua Jebb, the eminent English
engineer who gave the model for prison construction
to all the world, was clearly inspired by
him. In its main outlines Mazas greatly resembled
Pentonville. The ground plan was much the same.
There was the same radiation of halls or divisions
from a common centre. The same tiers of cells
rise story above story. The size of the cells (ten
feet by six), the method of ventilation and warming,
by means of hot water pipes with extraction
flues and furnaces in the roof, are nearly identical
in the French and English prisons. Nor was it
only in the construction of Mazas that the French
authorities sought to secure the perfection of the
new arrangements. With a tenderness for the welfare
of the occupants of the prison, which contrasted
almost violently with their previous apathy
as to the treatment of criminals, they tested its sanitary
fitness by filling it for a time with paupers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
before it was opened for prisoners. No evil effects
having appeared among the former it was deemed
safe for the latter and presently became the place
of detention for all male <i>pr&eacute;venus</i> or prisoners
awaiting trial. Such it long continued, and has only
been replaced by Fresnes since 1898.</p>

<p>The newly constructed prison of Mazas played
its part in the Napoleonic <i>coup d’&eacute;tat</i> of 1853. It
became for the time being a political prison. When
the Legislative Assembly was invaded and the
Chamber forcibly dissolved, two hundred of its
members met at the Mayoralty of the Tenth Arrondissement.
The place was surrounded by the
troops. An order to disperse was issued, with the
alternative of a transfer under escort to Mazas.
Their leaders were already imprisoned, among the
number Generals Cavaignac, Lamonci&egrave;re and Bedeau;
Colonel Charras, MM. Thiers, Broglie, Odillon,
Barot and Remusat. It was feared that to
commit a larger number to gaol might create a disturbance,
and the deputies now arrested were confined
in the barracks near the Quai d’Orsay. The
only interesting fact connected with this high-handed
treatment of political opponents by the
founders of the Second Empire was that M. Thiers
had been the minister who, in 1849, had decreed
the building of Mazas, and was, as we have seen,
one of the first to occupy it. History repeats itself.
Often before, as in the cases of Hugues d’Aubriot
at the Bastile and Cardinal La Balue at Loches,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
men had been cast into cells of their own creation.</p>

<p>Mazas, in the half century of its life, was always
a striking object on the boulevard of the same name,
which had been so called after a distinguished soldier
of the First Empire, the Colonel Mazas who
was killed at the Battle of Austerlitz. It was well
known to all travellers to the South of France from
the busy Gaol de Lyon, and with its grim fa&ccedil;ade of
dark granite was in strong contrast to the bright
boulevard crowded with vehicles and animated passers-by.
It was the privilege of the present writer
to pay it a lengthened visit in its palmy days, and
he may be permitted to draw upon his own experience
in describing it.</p>

<p>The outer approaches were easily passed. A first
gate was unlocked by a warder in dark green uniform,
with white metal buttons, bearing the badge
of an open eye. This gate led into an inner courtyard,
surrounded by storerooms and waiting rooms
with the fa&ccedil;ade of the director’s residence&mdash;bright
with masses of green creeper growing luxuriantly
on one side. On the ground floor was a second
portal where another Cerberus kept guard. To the
right of this second entrance was the office of the
<i>greffier</i>, or registrar of the prison, whose business
it was to examine the credentials of all who would
penetrate into the body of the prison. It was his
business also to take a minute description of all
prisoners on their reception, a formality known as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
the <i>&eacute;crou</i>, or enrolment upon the prison books.
These books are voluminous, but are very accurately
and carefully kept. The <i>signalement</i> of the prisoner
gave all information concerning him, a full account
of his personal appearance, of the clothes he was
wearing, and of his position in life.</p>

<p>The <i>greffier</i> satisfied, a few more steps led us to
another door, and this passed, we were in the <i>rond
point</i>, or central hall of the prison. In the middle
of this was a circular office and observatory, with
sides entirely of glass, where a superior warder
was posted to exercise a general supervision over
the long corridors of the radiating wings. There
were six of these wings arranged in three tiers
or landings, each containing two hundred cells, after
making due deductions for cells appropriated as
bathrooms and <i>parloirs d’avocats</i>, or places where
prisoners have private interviews with their attorneys.
The whole prison at that time accommodated
some eleven hundred souls. Although displaying
a strong family likeness to prisons of its class, there
was nothing particularly striking about the interior
of Mazas. The prison was not very trimly kept.
There was an absence of that spick and span cleanliness,
that glittering prison polish, that freshness
of paint and whitewash, which are generally deemed
indispensable in every first-class prison. Untidy
bales of goods, containing work just completed by
the prisoners lay here and there awaiting removal;
there was a good deal of litter about, and a suspicion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
of dust and soot. The walls throughout were
stained a muddy, yellowish brown, which could not
have been renewed for years. The passages were
floored with brick, as were also the cells. Odors
the reverse of fragrant in places assailed the nostrils.
The system of introducing fresh air and extracting
foul, although based on sound principles,
did not seem to be thoroughly effective. Flushing
was carried out by hand from water-cans supplied
to the prisoners, and was altogether unsatisfactory.
But with the cells and their furniture no great fault
could be found. The former were light and airy,
the latter supplied their occupants with those bare
necessaries which are usually conceded to the inmates
of prisons. The prisoner’s bed was a hammock
with a mattress stuffed with wool or hair,
and he had sheets and one blanket; in winter two
blankets. A small table was built into the wall,
about the centre of the cell. Over it was a gas jet,
and close by was a straw-bottomed chair, attached
to the wall by a chain just long enough to allow
the prisoner to move his seat to and fro. Besides
these he had an earthenware basin, a tin dinner dish,
a large tin bottle for water, a drinking cup, a
wooden spoon and spittoon. The cell walls were
adorned with official notices: the regulations of the
prison, in which all that the prisoner must and might
not do was set forth with considerable prolixity;
an inventory of what the cell contained and a list
of prices, approved by the Prefect of the Police,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
of the articles of consumption which the prisoner
might buy at the prison canteen with the money he
earned or was sent him by friends. Prisoners unconvicted
were, naturally, not compelled to work in
prisons, but they were invited, even persuaded, to
do so, and were at liberty to expend half the money
they might earn in purchasing small comforts or
adding to their daily fare. Those who preferred
it were permitted, as elsewhere, to supply themselves
altogether with food; and in cases where
the <i>pr&eacute;venu</i> was of good family, if he or his friends
were in funds, his meals came straight from a good
restaurant or his own home.</p>

<p>The inmate of Mazas could not well complain
of the neglect of the authorities, nor, judging by outward
appearances, of the harshness of their rule.
In addition to many minor indulgences, he was permitted
to purchase a certain fixed quantity of wine,
three double decilitres of good ordinary Bordeaux,&mdash;“<i>vieux,
pur, naturel, franc de go&ucirc;t</i>,” it is set
forth in the canteen notice,&mdash;and as much tobacco
as he could smoke when and where he pleased. He
had an excellent library of books at his disposal,
and might see his friends from outside when he
chose. In some respects, indeed, he might deem the
official solicitude for his welfare a little exaggerated
and misplaced. The law was before all things anxious
that he should do himself no harm. The precautions
against suicide were many and minute, and
included the deprivation of all dangerous weapons,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
with constant observation, extending, if necessary,
to the unceasing companionship of two or more fellow-prisoners.
With the recalcitrant <i>pr&eacute;venu</i> who
refuses to plead guilty these cell-comrades had other
duties to perform. They acted also as <i>moutons</i>,
(the prison spies already spoken of), and wheedled
the unconscious prisoner into incautious confessions,
of which full use was made later. Thus the notorious
murderer, Troppmann, confided his secret
to his prison attendants, and greatly assisted the
prosecution thereby. In his case the most extraordinary
care was taken to prevent his laying hands
upon himself. During his long detention he was
not allowed to shave, lest he should injure himself
with the razor. He appeared in court with a long
beard, which his advocate insisted should be removed.
The demand was only reluctantly conceded;
and the operation was carried out under
the close surveillance of a number of officers after
putting him in a strait waistcoat and tying him into
a chair.</p>

<p>Except, however, where the ends of justice seem
to require a special departure from the rule, isolation,
that is, the complete separation of prisoners
one from the other, was strictly maintained at
Mazas. All the arrangements of the prison were
based upon this idea&mdash;the private boxes of the
<i>parloir</i>, or visiting cell; the separate compartments
in the exercising yards, where each prisoner ranges
like a beast in a menagerie up and down a narrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
cage, in shape like a wedge cut out of a plum cake;
all are meant to secure the great end. Even the
method of conducting divine service was such that
every prisoner could attend mass without seeing or
being seen by his neighbors or leaving his own cell.
This was effected by establishing an altar on the top
of the office in the <i>rond point</i>, or central hall. The
<i>aumonier</i>, or prison chaplain, who officiated here,
could be seen from every cell in the prison. All the
doors were bolted ajar by a very ingenious arrangement.
The long steel bar which usually secured
the cell was shot for the time being into a ring projecting
from the casing of the door, and thus a
long, narrow aperture was left facing the altar,
but only a few inches wide. This system no doubt
prevented the intercommunication possible in an
open chapel; yet, while this can be reduced to a
minimum where discipline is strong and supervision
effective, the prisoner alone in his cell was
under no surveillance at all. He could behave just
as it suited him. A close observer, Maxime du
Camp, examined thirty-three cells, and observed
what their inmates were doing while mass was
being said. Three only were reading their missals
and following the priest; one was on his knees;
one was standing uncovered, looking towards the
altar; one had opened his prayer book, but for
choice was looking at the <i>Magasin Pittoresque</i>; one
other, with his head buried deep in his arms, was
shaken by a paroxysm of tears.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>Escapes were rarely attempted at Mazas, and if
tried were scarcely ever successful. Once a practised
locksmith contrived to remove the fastenings of his
cell during the night, to get through the bars beyond
and lower himself into the yard, where he
found a scaffold pole, and raising it against the
first wall climbed up by it to the top. It helped
him also to descend to the far side, where he came
upon the night watchman wrapped up in his cloak
and sleeping peacefully. The boundary wall had
still to be surmounted, but the scaffold pole was too
short. Foiled in this direction the fugitive retraced
his steps and now attacked the grating of the chief
sewer which passed under the outer wall, flowing
towards the river. He climbed down it, but unhappily
for him found that the Seine was in flood,
and, being unable to swim, was all but drowned.
He managed to extricate himself, however, and,
being now thoroughly worn out and disheartened,
he returned to his cell, where the evidence of his
fruitless efforts remained to convict him next morning.
Two other prisoners made a somewhat similar
attempt. They also removed their windows,
lowered themselves by ropes made from their bed
sheets, and, gaining the yard, forced the grating
of the sewer by means of bars taken from their
iron bedsteads. They entered the sewer, and, traversing
it for some distance, were stopped by a much
larger grating, which separated the prison branch
from the main sewer. This they also forced and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
were at liberty to issue forth, if they pleased, upon
the Seine. But by this time the alarm was given;
the fugitives were traced into the prison sewer;
all the sewer mouths were closely watched, and the
two men were re-captured a couple of days later.</p>

<p>Mazas as the prison of the <i>pr&eacute;venus</i>, the receptacle
of all persons accused of serious crime and
detained on reasonable presumption of guilt, was
intimately associated with the passing criminality
of Paris for fifty years. Every Ishmaelite, charged
with raising his hand against his fellows, passed
through its forbidding portals to emerge once more,
if fate was kind to him, or if convicted, to disappear
into its inner darkness. Confinement in a trial
prison is the most painful phase in the criminal’s
career. He is a constant prey to sickening anxiety,
or the plaything of exaggerated hope. He alternates
between overmuch confidence and dreadful
despair. His surroundings affect him according
to his quality. The cellular isolation, which is his
almost invariable lot, may be grateful to the victim
of circumstance, whether really innocent or by no
means hopelessly bad. The old offender, on the
other hand, suffers acutely, it is said, not so much
from remorse as from boredom and disgust; less
from the prickings of his conscience than self-reproach
at having played his cards badly and failed
in his latest attempt at depredation. In any case
the days are long when spent in a separate cell,
awaiting judgment, the nights dark and often sleepless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
and interminable. We have authentic assurance
that the end of it all, the very worst,&mdash;conviction,
sentence, the heaviest, the extreme penalty
of the law,&mdash;comes as a distinct relief, and although
a certain, shameful death is now before him, the
condemned prisoner sleeps soundly on his final return
from court. The prisoner condemned to death
is generally worn out with the struggle for life.
He is wearied, mentally and physically, and wishes,
as a rule, to forget the horrible episode which has
kept his faculties tense-strung, and, for a time at
least, he sinks into apathy and is more or less callous
of his impending fate. Now and again, and
this is specially characteristic of the French prisoner,
he is defiant with cynical bravado. He may
be passive, or active, as in the case of Camp, who,
when he reached his cell on return from the court
which had sentenced him, was seized with a fit of
fury, and, catching up a log of wood as a weapon,
rushed at a warder and attempted to murder him.
A curious trait in all condemned men is the survival
of hope to the very last.</p>

<p>In France, where in capital cases an appeal to
the law for the revision of the proceedings is the
rule, the convict is always buoyed up by the chance
of reprieve, and never finally yields until the officials
enter his cell on the last dread morning, and
he is awakened to hear the words, “It is for to-day.”
This means that death is imminent, and
that within a few minutes, half an hour at the outside,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
the guillotine will have done its work. It is
a cruel process, that of postponing all knowledge
of the exact day until it has arrived; although in
France murderers will exhibit the most ferocious
tiger-like attitude when it comes. “Dread anticipation
never leaves them,” a French chaplain, l’Abb&eacute;
Crozes, of the Grande Roquette, has recorded. “As
the inevitable day approaches they are consumed
with the liveliest fears, and are possessed with one
single idea, that of escaping death.” Two miscreants,
guilty of the most bloodthirsty murders, Abadie
and Gilles, who waited for three months before
the end came, told the same good priest that every
morning at four o’clock they awoke in an agony of
terror, and only recovered about six, when the hour
for communicating the dread news had passed for
the day. A similar story is that of the French
noble, lying with the rest of the prisoners in a Revolutionary
prison, who, as often as he heard the
list for execution each morning and missed his
name, cried out with intense relief: “The little
man has another day to live.”</p>

<p>The French practice of withholding from the
criminal information as to the day of his death
until almost the moment for execution has arrived
is cruel enough; but this chapter has shown an
amelioration in French prison conditions of such
extent that the cruelty of that practice may be condoned.

<p>The great prison of Mazas received criminals
of all sorts and of all degrees of atrocity in its day;
and we may here review the cases of several of
the most notable of these. The crimes of the
French poisoner De la Pommerais followed so
closely on those of Palmer, the English doctor who
ruthlessly dealt death to so many of his friends and
relations, that it is quite possible that the first
named owed something of his inspiration to the
example of the latter. The facilities offered to
medical practitioners for the administration of
lethal drugs have often tempted doctors to commit
murder when greedy for gain. This Frenchman
came to Paris from Orleans in 1839, when four and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
twenty years of age, and set up in practice as a
homœopathist. He gave lessons in that branch
of science, opened a dispensary, and gave medical
advice for small fees to the poorer classes. He
was a pretentious youth, who sought to pass as
a man of title, and called himself the Count de la
Pommerais. He also craved the decoration of St.
Sylvester from Pope Pius IX and the cross of the
Legion of Honor, but obtained neither, as may well
be imagined.</p>

<p>His fictitious rank, however, brought him a wife;
the orphan child of a military doctor, whom he married
much against the wish of her mother, a lady
of some private means. Madame Dubrizy as
she was named, lived only a couple months, and
died in horrible suffering after having dined with
La Pommerais. She had retained her fortune in
her own hands, for she distrusted as well as disliked
her son-in-law. He had produced securities
as his contribution to the marriage contract, which
she found were only borrowed for the occasion:
by her death he came into her money.</p>

<p>Strong suspicion of foul play was aroused when
a second sudden death occurred among his acquaintances.
A Madame de Pauw, widow of one
of his patients, died suddenly, although she did
not appear to have suffered from any previous illness.
The police had kept an eye on La Pommerais
for some time past. His <i>dossier</i>, “social character,”
was recorded at the Prefecture, and spoke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
him as a dangerous intriguer, who was in the habit
of visiting this Madame de Pauw frequently,
although they were in very different stations in
life. He made a great show, and was well received
in society, but she was reputed a mere pauper. On
this same <i>dossier</i> it was stated that he had probably
poisoned his deceased mother-in-law, although there
was no direct proof that he had done so.</p>

<p>Now the police ordered a post mortem on Madame
de Pauw, which was entrusted to the eminent
toxicologist Doctor Tardieu, who expressed his belief
that she had been poisoned, but could find no
trace of the drug. The cause of death had been
certified as a fall down-stairs. Then the deceased’s
sister informed against La Pommerais, stating that
he had effected a large insurance upon her life.
Here the influence of Palmer’s evil example was
obvious. Next the criminal himself gave ground
for fresh suspicion by his greediness in seeking payment
of the policies which he held. They had been
effected in eight different offices, and for a total
amount of 550,000 francs. The guilty intention
was clear, for the woman was in great indigence,
and the first premium of 18,840 francs had been
produced by La Pommerais. Further evidence was
abundantly forthcoming when the doctor was presently
arrested. A great quantity of different poisons
was found in his surgery, especially digitaline,
a preparation from the common foxglove, well
known for its baleful effect upon the heart.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>The actual arrest was made by the then head of
police, M. Claude, who has told the story in his
“Memoirs.” They were acquaintances, and La
Pommerais had so far presumed upon it as to ask
M. Claude to back him in soliciting the appointment
of medical officer at Mazas prison. When
the law was to be set in motion Claude kindly
thought to break the blow to the man at whose
table he had dined, and went in person to serve
the warrant. He found the two, man and wife, at
breakfast. “Good news,” he began, “you are to
have Mazas. I want you to come there with me
now.” The criminal changed countenance for a
moment, but the police officer reassured him. “The
fact is,” he went on, “the director of Mazas has
never been favorably disposed towards you, and
he may object, still, to your appointment. You
must let me bring you together, and we will talk
him over.” La Pommerais yielded with rather a
bad grace, and, on reaching the cab at the door in
which two policemen were already seated, he knew
his fate. This miscreant had one redeeming quality;
he was devotedly attached to his wife, and
it is said that when about to kneel down at the scaffold
under the fatal knife he gave a last kiss to the
priest in attendance, “pour Clothilde.”</p>

<p>A very curious story was communicated to the
press immediately after his execution, which has
since been definitely contradicted. It was to the
effect that a certain Doctor Velpeau had obtained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
a promise from La Pommerais that he would make
him some sign after he had passed the threshold
of the grave. Velpeau is reported to have said to
La Pommerais: “When the knife falls I shall be
there, just in front of the scaffold, and I shall arrange
that your head, when decapitated, comes at
once into my hands. I propose to whisper into
your ear, ‘Monsieur, as we have agreed, will you
now, on hearing my voice, lower your right eyelid
three times, keeping the left eye open?’” Velpeau
declared that he carried out his part of the compact,
and was prepared to swear that the severed head
had twice made the sign as arranged; but the eyelid
would not lift a third time, and, although Velpeau
again and again asked for the sign, none came,
and the head assumed a fixed rigidity. Death had
put an end to the convulsive spasms by which possibly
the previous signs had been produced. The
story is extravagant and apocryphal, for the Abb&eacute;
Crozes, when invited to give his opinion, settled the
matter by declaring that Velpeau had never had
any conversation with the dead man, and as a matter
of fact was not present at the execution at all.</p>

<p>France contains in her criminal records one of
the worst murders ever committed in any civilised
country. The Crime of Pantin, as it was called
at the time, was the wholesale massacre of a family&mdash;father,
mother and six children&mdash;with the
sole idea of becoming possessed of property to
which no survivor could lay claim. Troppmann,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
who perpetrated it, laid the plan with such devilish
ingenuity that for a long time the guilt was attributed
to the father, Jean Kinck, assisted by his eldest
son, and the first inquiries were centred upon them.</p>

<p>On the morning of the twentieth of September,
1869, at an early hour a workman, in crossing the
plain of Pantin beyond the Buttes-Chaumont, to
the northeast of Paris, noticed the traces of much
blood spilt upon the ground, and near them a blood-stained
handkerchief. Further on he saw protruding
above the ground a human arm imperfectly
buried, and using a spade he dug up, first one body
and afterwards five more,&mdash;the body of a woman
and those of five children. Some of the clothes
carried buttons with the address of a tailor in Roubaix,
who recognised them as having been ordered
by a fellow townsman, by name Jean Kinck. This
Kinck was absent from home. He had summoned
his wife and children to join him in Paris on the
nineteenth of September. They had duly arrived
and taken rooms at a hotel near the Northern Railway
Station, where the husband was already staying,
having registered himself the week before
under the name, Jean Kinck of Roubaix. He did
not meet his wife on arrival, and she seemed much
upset, but went out almost immediately with all
her children, and never returned. Next morning,
however, Jean Kinck came in, went up to his room,
changed his clothes and again left, but before the
discovery of the corpses was generally known.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>Suspicion was soon drawn to this supposed
Kinck, and it was found that some one like him
had bought a pick and shovel at a toolmaker’s shop,
which, later in the evening, he had carried off in
the direction of Pantin. No doubt he was bent on
digging the graves of his victims. Full details of
his appearance, his condition and ways of life presently
arrived from Roubaix. He was fifty years
of age, gray haired, short of stature and well built,
an industrious, enterprising brush maker, anxious
to extend his business; for which purpose he had
left Roubaix five weeks previously for Alsace,
where he already owned a house. He meant to
sell it and buy a larger one, in which he could live,
and, at the same time, carry on his trade. Madame
Kinck, a native of Turcoing, did not favor this
project. She did not want to move to Germany,
as she did not speak the language, and differences
had arisen between the pair, supplying some motive
for the murder. Three days passed before any satisfactory
information came to hand. Nothing had
been heard of the father, Jean Kinck, nothing of
the son, but the father had left Roubaix in the
beginning of September, the son Gustav eight or
ten days later: it was generally believed that the
Kinck who appeared at the hotel of the Northern
Railway Station was Gustav, as the personal description
tallied with him better than with the
father.</p>

<p>Now, as so often happens in mysterious criminal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
cases, a bolt came from the blue. Jean Kinck, or
some one passing for him, was suddenly arrested
at Havre. Chance had strangely intervened in the
interests of justice, and detection followed in an
entirely unexpected manner. News was telegraphed
to Paris that Jean Kinck had been arrested at
Havre under peculiar circumstances. On the morning
of the twenty-third of September a young man
entered a caf&eacute; on the sea front at Havre, and became
engaged in conversation with a sailor, whom
he met there. He was anxious to know what steps
to take to secure a passage for America. “Your
papers must be in order,” was the first answer he
received, and it came, not from his friend, but from
an officious gendarme, who was loafing about the
place, and inspired by the restless spirit of interference
which so constantly disturbs the official
mind. “You have your papers of course?” He
received a negative reply. “No? Then you must
come with me to the police office.” There was
nothing for it but to obey, and they started off together,
chatting pleasantly, but the stranger was
manifestly uneasy, and when there was a sudden
stoppage in the traffic he slipped aside and ran
towards one of the basins of the dock. The gendarme
followed close in his tracks, shouting, “Stop
him, stop him! He is a murderer,” and there was
little hope for the fugitive amidst the gathering
crowd. But with one bound he sprang into the
water, caught a floating buoy, and hung on there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
between life and death until he was fished out by
some of the sailors with ropes and boat-hooks, and
brought to shore half drowned. He was carried
to the hospital, where he was put to bed and interviewed
at once by the Commissary, to whom he
would make no reply. He was a young man of
about twenty, short, dark, with black eyes, a long
beaky nose and close cut hair, a description which answered
in many respects, save that of youth, to the
missing Jean Kinck. His identity was established,
however, beyond all doubt by the papers found on
him. All of them were documents connected with
the Kinck family. There was a contract for the
sale of a house in Roubaix; notes of hand signed
by Kinck in favor of people of the town; the contract
of a house from another proprietor, and a
number of private papers and letters in a pocketbook
with a morocco purse, trimmed with copper, containing
several coins; a silk handkerchief and some
five-franc pieces; a valuable gold watch, a second
watch, a small ring, a medallion and a pocket knife.
Doubts were still expressed as to the identity of
Jean Kinck, and it was generally supposed that he
was Gustav. But then other letters were found in
his possession, addressed to a certain Troppmann,
and eventually it was proved that this was really
his name.</p>

<p>The police paid an immediate visit to Roubaix
to make further inquiries, and found that this
Troppmann was a personal friend of Jean Kinck.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
In the house were a number of letters purporting
to be from the husband, but, as was explained in
one of them, written by another hand because Kinck
had injured his wrist. These were the letters that
had persuaded Madame Kinck to come to Paris.
When the judges undertook the interrogation it
was proved beyond doubt that these were from a
mechanical engineer, an Alsacian by birth, who had
long been intimate with Kinck, and constantly visited
him at the drinking shop of the “Re-union
of Friends,” of which Kinck was proprietor.
Troppmann, when questioned, freely admitted these
facts, and it was soon plainly seen that he bore the
marks of a recent struggle with some enraged female.
His cheeks were torn and scratched with
many wounds; there were marks of nails that had
gone deep into his flesh. Troppmann, who was
brought without delay to Paris and confronted with
the corpses in the Morgue, made no difficulty of
recognising and identifying them; and he went so
far as to confess that the murder had been organised
by the Kincks, father and son, with his knowledge,
although he had taken no active part in it. He
refused to throw any light upon the whereabouts
of the Kincks. As the inquiry proceeded, witnesses
came forward who recognised Troppmann as the
person who had bought the pick and shovel at the
tool shop, and all that was now needed was to prove
a motive for the crime. His possession of Kinck’s
watch and valuables was <i>prima facie</i> evidence, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
there were those who spoke as to the close relations
that had existed between them. Troppmann was
greedy for money, and was continually proposing
schemes, promising great profit to Kinck if he
would go into them. He was for ever begging
him to advance capital, but Kinck was cautious,
and would not risk a sou. Not less did Troppmann
devise plans, by which he might bleed Jean Kinck,
and the last seemed likely to succeed. He declared
that he had discovered in the Alsacian mountains
a plentiful supply of precious metals, gold, silver
and mercury in large quantities, ready to be extracted
by any enterprising hand.</p>

<p>Jean Kinck’s movements were at last traced. He
had left Roubaix on the twenty-fourth of August,
three or four weeks before the discovery of the
bodies at Pantin, saying he would return in a few
days. He went into Alsace, and was met by Troppmann,
with whom he travelled by diligence to
Soultz. This was the last heard of him, although
letters not in his own hand reached Madame Kinck
at Roubaix. A search had been made, however,
in the neighborhood where he had last been seen,
and his body was at last found, not far from Wattwiller,
in a forest at the foot of the ruins of the
ancient stronghold of Henenflung. It had been
buried beneath a heap of stones raised high above
the grave. The cause of death was not immediately
apparent, but doctors presently reported that
he had been poisoned with Prussic acid administered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
probably from a flask. No doubt he had been
inveigled to this spot by fictitious reports of the
presence of gold. Thus the last victim was accounted
for, Gustav Kinck, the eldest son, having
been disinterred some days before at no great distance
from the other bodies in the plain of Pantin.
The chain of damning evidence was complete.
Link by link it wound round the accused, and definitely
secured conviction upon trial. But every
point had first been elicited beyond all doubt by
the “instructing” or interrogating judge at Mazas,
although Troppmann long took refuge in persistent
denial of every fact or in obstinate silence. At last
came the confrontation. The prisoner, who was
examined throughout at Mazas in a large cell in
the infirmary, was taken down to the Morgue, and
suddenly brought into the presence of the corpse
of Gustav Kinck, but then just discovered. He
was seized with violent emotion, hid his face in a
handkerchief, and refused to look at his murderous
handiwork. “Come now,” insisted the magistrate,
“confess that you struck the blow.” “No, no, it
wasn’t I.” And he repeatedly asserted that the
elder Kinck had taken his son’s life. This was his
line of defence in court, greatly elaborated by his
counsel, Maitre Lachaud, perhaps the most famous
and eloquent advocate who has practised at the
French bar; but he also asserted that Troppmann
had accomplices, who should have been arraigned
with him, and he insisted that it was wickedly unfair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
to allow one culprit to bear the whole brunt of
the crime. The jury, however, remained unmoved
by his impassioned appeal, and almost immediately
found Troppmann guilty on all counts, on which
the judge, never having accepted the theory of
accomplices and satisfied that the law had laid its
hand upon the real perpetrator of the crime, sentenced
him to death. He was sent to the Conciergerie
to await removal to the Grand Roquette.</p>

<p>Troppmann spent his last hours in a vain combat
with the authorities, but after maintaining it for
some days he fell into a state of prostration, and,
when he came out to die, was already a broken-down,
worn-out, old man of fifty, more than double
his years. When they came to warn him for execution,
he essayed to appear unconcerned, and,
throughout the remainder of the painful scene,
fought hard, but of course fruitlessly, for his life.
Although subjected to the “toilette” and secured
by straps and cords, he managed to break loose
when on the scaffold, and strenuously resisted as
they led him to the block. When his neck was laid
under the axe of the guillotine, he pushed it so far
forward that the axe on falling would have struck
his shoulder, but the executioner held him in his
place and deftly touched the spring which released
the knife, and all was over. But the dying man in
his frantic resistance had managed to get the executioner’s
hand into his mouth and bit it fiercely.</p>

<p>The trial of Troppmann was in its way a public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
scandal. The court was crammed with curious
spectators, whose morbid minds drew them to stare
at the hero of this horrible tragedy as though he
were a wild beast in a menagerie, about to be subjected
to physical torture. People of the highest
rank and fashion demeaned themselves to gain
places in the audience by any means; by social intrigues,
by using private influence with the judges
and officers of the court. Troppmann was the centre
of attraction, the cynosure of every eye. His
features and demeanor were closely scanned, his
dress was commented upon critically. It was noted,
also, that he was clean shaved. This was on the
demand of his counsel, who hoped that his small,
youthful face, which when smooth and hairless
looked like that of a lad of fifteen, would impress
the jury with the idea that he could not possess the
strength to handle a knife with such deadly effect
as had been exhibited in the cruel wounds of his
victims. Before the barber, however, was permitted
to use the razor, Troppmann was put into
a strait-waistcoat (<i>camisole de force</i>); he was
tied down in a chair, with one warder on either
hand, ready to seize him and check any attempt at
self-destruction. Troppmann laughed at these precautions,
and plainly hinted that he had means of
suicide at his disposal, of which they had no idea.
It was known that Troppmann had himself manufactured
the prussic acid he gave to Kinck. But
he disdained to use them or to bring discredit on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
his family, a rather far-fetched nicety in a miscreant
who had been guilty of such crimes.</p>

<p>They were not all murderers who passed through
Mazas, although some were top-sawyers in the
criminal business, such as Shaw, the Englishman
who stole the Duke of Brunswick’s diamonds.
It will be remembered that one of the most marked
features in the eccentric character of the late
Duke of Brunswick was his passion for precious
stones. He long made Paris his principal home,
and resided in a quaint old mansion in the Beaujour
quarter, a house with red walls, massive gateways
and innumerable bolts and bars. The Duke, a worn-out
voluptuary, a faded old beau, who, on the rare
occasions when he showed himself in public, came
out painted, made up and bewigged, lived here quite
secluded among his treasures, which he kept in an
enormous iron safe. These jewels were valued at
&pound;600,000, a splendid collection, accumulated at
great cost, and carried off by him when he fled from
his principality. They served no purpose but to
gratify his greedy passion for possession. Except
when he had taken them out to gloat over them,
these priceless gems never saw the light. He took
the most painful care of them. They were lodged in
an inner apartment, to reach which it was necessary
to pass through the Duke’s study and bedroom.
There were electric wires communicating with many
bells to give warning of the approach of any unauthorised
person; other bells were attached to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
triggers of revolvers to fire them off automatically
at any intruder. It was the Duke’s craze, not altogether
unfounded, that thieves were always aiming
at him. He thought that all the world wanted to
rob him. At his particular request two police officers
watched constantly over him, seldom letting him
out of their sight, and keeping a careful eye upon
his treasure house. The fact that the Duke of
Brunswick’s house was full of rich booty was known
to every depredator in Europe, and a thousand plans
were devised to break in and rifle it. At last England
acquired the questionable credit of overcoming
all obstacles, and carrying off the Duke’s diamonds.</p>

<p>In 1863 the Duke had an English valet, a very
confidential personage named Shaw, a native of
Newcastle-on-Tyne. He had got the place in the
ordinary way through a registry office, supported
by first-class references, all forged; he proved himself
to be a very excellent servant, quiet, attentive,
much liked by both his master and his fellows. He
was really the agent and confederate of a gang of
thieves who had especially selected him for the job
they had in view. It was his business to become
familiar with the safe and its surroundings, taking
the first opportunity to “lift” its contents when
he could do so without danger to himself. The
safe stood in a receptacle behind an iron door in
the wall at the head of the Duke’s bed, and a silk
curtain hung in front of this door, which was secured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
with special locks. These might be picked
some day, but in behind was the great safe with
its alarm bells and automatic batteries of firearms.
There was infinite danger in interfering with these.
Only the practised hand of some one in the secret
of the machinery would dare to risk it. Shaw was
patient and bided his time.</p>

<p>One day (December 17, 1863) the Duke sent
for a working jeweller he employed, meaning to
have certain changes made in the setting of some
of his stones. In anticipation he opened the inner
safe and, contrary to his custom, left it open. This
did not escape Shaw, who was in attendance, but
he hoped little from it until he saw his royal master,
wearied of waiting for the jeweller, go out without
relocking his safe. The Duke was satisfied to
secure the external door at the head of the bed.</p>

<p>This was Shaw’s opportunity. He had a picklock,
and soon used it with good effect on this the
first obstacle. There was no second or inner defence,
and the safe door being ajar the machinery
did not work. He was, in fact, master of the situation,
and with all haste made the most of it. The
Duke’s treasures lay at his mercy, jewel-cases, diamond
stars, bags of gold. He soon filled his pockets
and hurried out, being careful to close the outer
door and pull the curtain across, hoping that the
abstraction might not be immediately observed.
Having packed a small valise with a few effects
he told a fellow-servant to take up his service with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
the Duke, on the ground that he was unwell, and
then slipped out of the house.</p>

<p>The theft was, however, quickly discovered, and
the French police were put on the alert. Shaw
immediately betrayed himself by addressing an
anonymous letter to a royal personage in London,
in which the writer offered to restore to their rightful
owners, the English royal family, certain jewels
wrongfully detained by the Duke of Brunswick, on
receiving a reward of 100,000 francs. This letter
was at once handed over to the authorities in Scotland
Yard, who passed it on to Paris. A postscript
was added to the letter, stating that the writer
would meet any messenger sent with the money at
Boulogne. Acting at once on this clue, the French
detectives hastened to Boulogne, and, visiting every
hotel, soon found a young man answering the description,
who was arrested and taken back to Paris.
The diamonds were found in his possession. This
Shaw, a tall, very thin young man, with a pale,
intelligent face, and very bold, prominent eyes, was
soon recognised by the police as a professional thief
of English extraction, who had worked much
abroad, and was indeed a cosmopolitan rogue, having
committed many great robberies in the capitals
of Europe, generally by the same means. He was
sentenced to twenty years (<i>travaux forc&eacute;s</i>), although
the Duke, dreading the publicity of the Assize
court, would not appear to prosecute.</p>

<p>The prison known as La Sant&eacute; was situated in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
the rue de la Sant&eacute; close to the Boulevard Arago,
upon the left bank of the Seine. Founded and completed
in the palmiest days of the French Empire,
it was the newest and certainly long the best prison
in Paris. Enthusiastic Frenchmen have, indeed, declared
that it was the best and most beautiful building
of the kind in Europe, but the statement is
rather far-fetched. Coming twenty years later than
Mazas, it was a marked advance upon that penitentiary,
which it resembled in many respects. It
consisted of two distinct divisions, or “sides,” and
the inmates of each were subjected to different systems
of imprisonment. In one, unbroken cellular
confinement was the rule, in the other, prisoners
occupied separate sleeping cells at night, but took
their food and exercise, and worked together during
the day. The former r&eacute;gime was applied to all
sentenced for the first time, the latter to <i>r&eacute;cidivistes</i>,
or habitual offenders, who fell into trouble again
and again. The cellular division, that first reached
when the threshold of the prison, with its sleepy
gatekeepers and punctilious <i>greffier</i>, was passed, was
cleaner and tidier than Mazas as I saw it, and altogether
better kept. There were the same radiating
wings, extending like the spokes of a wheel round
a central nave, the <i>rond point</i>; in which was the
same glass house or observatory, with an altar on
top, towards which all the cell doors, as to their
Mecca, religiously turned for the Mass. The cells
were warmed and ventilated by an arrangement of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
hot water pipes and fresh air flues, just as is seen
in every modern prison since the days of Sir Joshua
Jebb. The cells at La Sant&eacute; were spacious and
fairly clean; their furniture and fittings of more
modern design than those of Mazas. The hammock
was replaced by an iron bedstead, the table
was a flap, fastened on hinges to the wall, and a
three-legged stool replaced the rush-bottomed chair
chained by the leg. The floor was boarded, not
paved with bricks, and no small pains were taken
to polish the oak planks, which were rubbed vigorously
till they shone like parquetry. All parts
of the cells were not so entirely above reproach,
and a severely critical eye would detect a certain
want of neatness in the interior economy of many.
Here and there rubbish was suffered to accumulate
and lie untouched. Upon a shelf in one cell was
a quantity of broken bread; in another several clay
pipes and a half empty wine carafe; the walls of
a third, occupied by a prison bookbinder, were hung
with scraps of tawdry decoration, crucifixes, hearts,
monograms shaped out of the gold leaf and colored
paper which he used in his trade. Prisoners
were permitted, too, to deface their cells with impunity
by scribbling on the notice boards and writing
on the walls. Remarks upon the articles supplied
from the canteen appeared upon the price list.
Expressions of regret, vows of vengeance, even,
were recorded upon the boards of rules. The prison
almanac, prepared by the good chaplain for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
special behoof of prisoners, with appropriate texts
and maxims, served really as a calendar, such as
school boys keep, to mark off the days as they slowly
dragged along towards release.</p>

<p>Behind and beyond the cellular quarter of the
prison was the “associated” prison, consisting of
two spacious quadrangles, in which were the exercising
yards and the lavatories, while around it were
arrayed the ateliers, or workshops, and the dining
halls. Upon an upper floor were the sleeping cells,
each containing a bedstead, and nothing more, each
lighted by means of a large barred opening above
the cell doors, through which shone the light of
gas lamps in the corridors. The crowded ateliers of
La Sant&eacute;, instinct with busy life, were an interesting
and instructive sight, and from them a fairly good
idea could be obtained of the peculiar conditions
under which prison labor is utilised in France. This
is everywhere accomplished through the intervention
of a contractor or employer from outside, who
provides tools, materials and instructors, and takes
in return half the earnings of the prisoners. The
other half, known as the <i>p&eacute;cule</i>, goes to the prisoner
himself, and this is again sub-divided into the
<i>p&eacute;cule disponible</i> and the <i>p&eacute;cule reserv&eacute;</i>, the former
of which can be drawn upon and expended by the
prisoner in adding to his creature comforts whilst
incarcerated; the latter, accumulating from day to
day, to be handed over to him upon his release to
provide means of support during those early days
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
of freedom, when a man is hesitating between honesty
and the temptation to relapse into fresh crime.</p>

<p>The contract system appears open to many grave
objections; for instance, that it introduces “lay”
or outside influences, erecting in the prison a second
authority, to which prisoners look for praise
or blame rather than to the constituted chiefs of
the place. At times a certain antagonism might
arise between the two; the one looks naturally to
profits, the other to maintenance of effective discipline,
and where the first was affected, the latter
would no doubt sensibly suffer. As an instance
of this may be quoted the case of prisoners sentenced
to very short terms, who, if they are not
already acquainted with some trade, do absolutely
nothing at all whilst in prison. To teach them a
<i>metier</i> would be to waste time and materials, and
there is in France no “penal labor,”&mdash;as it is commonly
understood in England,&mdash;no sharp, correctional
employment, such as the treadwheel, stone
breaking, or oakum picking, the execution of which
requires no special previous knowledge or skill.
As a matter of fact, therefore, prison has but few
horrors for the offender committed for less than
a week, except in the temporary loss of liberty;
and in all that relates to physical comfort, indeed,
in food, shelter and clothing, he is often far better
off inside than out. His confinement may be irksome
and monotonous, time may hang rather heavily
on his hands; still he manages to get pretty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
comfortably through his days, lounging lazily about
the refectories, or ranging up and down in the
exercising yards, pipe in mouth, and gossiping with
any one he meets.</p>

<p>These idlers, it must be confessed, were, at La
Sant&eacute;, the exception and not the rule. There was
no little stir and bustle in the workrooms; the
occupations were many and varied; the prisoners
were industrious and often exhibited no mean skill.
Parisians are naturally a quick-witted and nimble-fingered
race, whose talents, when in durance, prison
contractors know well how to turn to the best account.
At La Sant&eacute; we found tailors at work upon
clothes for the slop shops, shoemakers and cobblers
making excellent slippers and shoes. Here a cabinet-maker
completed a drawing-room chair; there,
by his side, an upholsterer covered another in damask
or silk. Long rows of prisoners, seated upon
benches, manufactured feather brushes for dusting
furniture, or dolls and children’s toys, or paper
boxes for bonbons and patent medicines, or frills
of the same material for the cooks and confectioners.
Some were staining and coloring sheets of
paper for the bookbinders, to be subsequently varnished
and polished; others, in large numbers, were
employed upon the manufacture of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;
boot buttons through all the various stages of inserting
the eyelet holes in rows upon the pasteboard,
stamping out the buttons, trimming them, hardening
them and varnishing them. A certain air of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
contentment, if not of actual good humor, was visible
on every side. Prisoners met my eye, and did
not immediately hang their heads and look down.
Silence was the general rule, but they talked <i>sotto
voce</i> to one another, and to me if I cared to address
them. One man, proud of his English, told me of
“another English gentleman,” who recently came
to La Sant&eacute;. “As a visitor?” “Oh, no, as a <i>detenu</i>
(prisoner).” Others, if I appeared interested
in the work in hand, would explain all its intricacies,
and return my salutation with the bow of a
finished courtier when I took leave. All the while
the warders in charge exercised an easy-going surveillance,
and were evidently neither hard taskmasters
nor severe disciplinarians.</p>

<p>In the workshops, as elsewhere, it was obvious
that the prison rule did not err on the side of severity.
Every care was taken to assure the moral
and physical comfort of the prisoners. There were
chaplains of all persuasions, and intolerance was
unknown. For Roman Catholics, naturally the
largest number, there were the regular services in
the <i>rond point</i>, with which a large associated chapel
communicated. There was a special chapel for
Protestants, and a synagogue for Jews. A well-stocked
library, annually replenished, provided literature
of nearly every kind for all who cared to
read. The books were carefully selected, but included
works of fiction, which are often forbidden
in the prisons of some countries. The only novels
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
permitted however at La Sant&eacute;,&mdash;and the choice
implies a high compliment to English literature,&mdash;were
translations of Dickens, Fenimore Cooper,
Bulwer-Lytton, Marryat and Scott, which were admitted
confessedly on account of their morality and
purity of tone. These, it was said, were the books
in most constant demand.</p>

<p>The hospital arrangements at La Sant&eacute;, which
was long a central depot for all male prisoners requiring
prolonged treatment, were also excellent of
their kind. The wards were large and lofty, and
were well warmed by a clever contrivance, consisting
of two concentric iron cylinders, one within
the other, between which hot water circulated, while
fresh external air was passed in at the base and
diffused from the centre and top after being
warmed. The clothing of all prisoners was good
and sufficient, although custom had nicknamed the
prison shirt <i>la limace</i> because it had all the rasping
roughness of a file. As to food, the inmates of
La Sant&eacute; certainly could not complain. The diet
of English prisoners of similar category may have
been more varied, but it was scarcely more replete.
There were two regular meals at La Sant&eacute;, one
about eight o’clock in the morning, the other at
three. Both consisted of a pint, or more exactly,
two-thirds of a litre, of thin soup, not unlike a poor
Julienne, but tasty and carefully made by officer
cooks, who winked pleasantly when I praised it,
and agreed with me that it was <i>pas mauvais</i>, “not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
so bad,” after all. Twice a week, on Sundays and
Thursdays, four ounces of cooked meat, without
bone, were added, and on these days the prisoner
got about twenty-seven ounces of bread. When
there was no meat the bread ration was nearly
thirty ounces. But the foregoing did not comprise
all that the prisoner had to eat. Those who were
in funds, whether from private sources or from
the <i>p&eacute;cule disponible</i> already referred to, were permitted
to sweeten prison life and eke out prison
fare by various articles of food on sale at the canteen.
The list was long, and the prices were not
extravagant. For a few centimes smoked herrings
could be bought, or a slice of cheese, fresh and salt
butter, sausages, cooked ham, liquorice, boiled potatoes
and a fair allowance of red wine. Tobacco
unlimited could also be purchased, a privilege often
peremptorily forbidden elsewhere in many prisons,
as are indeed all such toothsome additions as those
just enumerated.</p>

<p>But La Sant&eacute; passed away, absorbed into the new
and extensive establishment at Fresnes on the outskirts
of Paris, designed to remodel the entire penal
system of the French government. La Sant&eacute; was a
long step forward in penology; and Fresnes, the
next and a still longer step, has now to be described.

depravity largely due to La Petite Roquette.</p>

<p>Among the prisons of Paris two long survived
which were really a standing disgrace to France.
These were St. P&eacute;lagie and Saint Lazare. They
were types of a bygone age. Both were ancient
edifices, centuries old, planted in the very heart of
crowded localities. They were radically vicious in
construction and very backward in the system of
discipline in force. In both, continuous association
and unrestrained intercourse were permitted among
prisoners, so that contamination and deterioration
were the inevitable results.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>St. P&eacute;lagie received only males&mdash;those sentenced
correctionally to terms of thirteen months and less,
and with them were incarcerated offenders against
the adulteration laws, fraudulent bankrupts for
small sums, and traders who used short weights.
All were herded together indiscriminately, the only
exception being made in favor of journalists sentenced
for contravention of press laws, all of whom
came to it, where they were subjected to a special
and entirely different r&eacute;gime from the ordinary
prisoners.</p>

<p>St. P&eacute;lagie stood in a quiet and retired part of
Paris behind the H&ocirc;pital de la Piti&eacute; and the labyrinth
of the Jardin des Plantes. It was essentially
a prison on the associated plan and found no favor
in the sight of French prison administrators who
are warm adherents of the principle of cellular
separation.</p>

<p>Nothing much can be done with a building not
originally intended for the uses to which it is
applied. It dates from the seventeenth century,
and the charity of a good lady, Marie Bonneau,
widow of Beauharnais de Miramion, who created
it as a refuge for her unfortunate sisterhood, and
gave it as patron the dancer who turned saint,&mdash;with
whom Charles Kingsley made us acquainted
in his novel of “Hypatia.” It was also appropriated
for debtors and later for political prisoners,
more especially those who offended by their too
critical pens. A block known as the “Pavilion”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
was given over to them exclusively, to which no
strangers were admitted; but these litterateurs
might be seen all over the prison at any time and
beyond their own quarters, commonly called
“greater” or “lesser Siberia;” the “big” or
“little Tomb.” Their confinement was not irksome,
and we are told that they often obtained permission
to leave the prison and visit the theatre at
night, even to sleep out, always on their solemn
promise to return honorably. The famous Proudhon
was allowed to take an afternoon walk unattended,
beyond the walls. Some of the inmates
amused themselves by playing blind man’s buff in
the dark passages, and once a mock trial was organised
at a sham revolutionary tribunal. By and by
the play was repeated in grim earnest. During the
Commune there was another trial within St. P&eacute;lagie,
ordered by Raoul Rigault, the Communist
Prefect of Police, on a prisoner who was promptly
sentenced to death and shot.</p>

<p>A good deal of work was done at St. P&eacute;lagie.
Prisoners were very industrious and produced good
results. One form of trade was the manufacture
of paper lamp-shades. Another was that of chignons
when this particular style was in fashion.
The raw material came from all quarters; the hair
merchants bought it from living heads and the
chiffoniers picked it up out of the streets. Possibly
had the origin of these adornments been better understood,
ladies would have been a little loath to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
wear them. St. P&eacute;lagie has now disappeared and
cannot be greatly regretted.</p>

<p>Saint Lazare was long the principal prison for
females in Paris. Within its vast <i>enceinte</i>, which
includes gardens, fountains and trees, and which is
now doomed to early abolition, were collected
women of all categories,&mdash;those awaiting trial;
those sentenced for short terms, and those doomed
to go beyond the seas; young girls, some of them
quite children, committed to prison at the instance
of their parents, “for correction;” and last of all,
the unhappy, “<i>filles publiques</i>,” who whether “<i>soumises</i>”
or “<i>insoumises</i>,” whether officially inscribed
on the police rolls or independently practising
their profession, have offended against one or
other of the stringent enactments by which the
fallen sisterhood are controlled in Paris. The various
classes, it is true, are kept as far as possible,
even scrupulously apart; but all are practically
under one and the same roof and really do intermingle
rather freely. The system cannot but be
demoralising in the extreme. It is strongly condemned
by all earnest, thoughtful Frenchmen, who
characterise Saint Lazare as a detestable place,
which should forthwith cease to be a prison.
“Every young girl,” says Du Camp, “who enters
Saint Lazare for correction, leaves it corrupt and
rotten to the core.... She is lost unless a miracle
intervenes, and the day of miracles is past.” While
such association continues, all efforts, and they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
many, to protect the still pure or win back the
fallen to virtuous ways, cannot but be made in
vain.</p>

<div id="i_200" class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>Hospice de la Salp&ecirc;triere, Paris</i></p>

<p>Hospital or almshouse for helpless and insane women.
Formerly it was a house of detention as well as a hospital,
and the treatment was extremely brutal. As many as ten
thousand persons have lived within the walls at one time.</p>

<img src="images/i_200.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Saint Lazare was originally a convent, and with
its spacious interior, great dormitories and wide
refectories was well suited for a religious house,
but it was quite unfit to serve as a prison. The
hideous herding together of so many classes, of innocent
and guilty, of the absolutely bad and vicious
with the young and still unspoilt, is a disgrace to
civilisation. Yet great attention is paid to discipline,
and ghostly ministrations abound at Lazare.
Priests and chaplains there are many to preach and
confess; philanthropic ladies come from outside to
exhort and expound, and the whole establishment
is under the watchful control of a religious sisterhood,
that of Marie Joseph, an order which has
continuously charged itself with prison labors, and
whose devotion and self-sacrifice are beyond all
praise. A religious atmosphere prevails. These
poor women exhibit often a remarkable piety, very
touching in such a place. When a party of prisoners
is on the point of starting for the Palace of
Justice, every woman expecting sentence kneels
before a sacred image and prays for mercy from
her earthly judge. This sentiment is further exhibited
by the writings on the walls, which are not
strictly forbidden as in most gaols. One familiar
with them has collected some of the most striking,
such as: “God is good, He will have pity on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
unfortunate.” “Holy Virgin, I give you my heart;
deign to take me under your protection and do not
visit my early sins too hardly upon me.” It has
well been remarked that the moral effect of Saint
Lazare and its surroundings works wonderfully in
aid of conversion and reformation. The spectacle
of the sisterhood, brought there by a high sense of
duty and not merely to earn a living, has an excellent
influence upon the fallen and misguided creatures
who are under their charge, to whom they
devote their unstinting efforts. Another note, that
of hungry, unsatisfied affection, can also be read in
these inscriptions: “Whoever comes into this cell,
your sufferings will never be so acute as when you
are separated from the person you love;” again,
“My love languishes in this cell, and far from thee
whom I adore I constantly groan and grieve.”
Sometimes the very opposite feeling finds voice:
“Henriette loved her man more than any one, but
to-day she hates him.” “I am dying to see him,
and if I find he is unfaithful when I come out I will
have his neck broken. It is through him that I am
here, but I love him all the same with all my heart.”
“I cannot forget my dead love which has lodged
me here; when I am released my lover may expect
to meet me armed with a revolver.” Some are
buoyed up by inexhaustible hope: “This is the first
day of my instruction (interrogation); the judgment
of God is everything, that of man nothing.”
“Let us endure our tribulations without murmuring;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
if they are undeserved our sins will expiate.”</p>

<p>Too often the male sex exhibit a very different
spirit. With them it is an ardent passion for vengeance,
inditing hatred for a treacherous companion,
misplaced pride in their evil deeds. It is “Death
to the judge!” “We will avenge our sufferings!”
“Vive anarchy!” “Vive the revolution!” “Some
day we will blow up all the prisons!” Innumerable
phrases like the following are to be met with: “I
will kill you when I get out;” “Death to the spy
Fernand, who got me here; I will cut him open.”
“I should have been acquitted, but my wife betrayed
my real name; let her look out!” “B&mdash;&mdash;
the victim missed his vengeance on his miserable
brother, but it will come yet,” and so on. The r&eacute;gime
of isolation apparently does not stimulate very
edifying thoughts.</p>

<p>Reference has been made in another volume
of this series to the marriages of convicts under the
sentimental idea of regenerating society in New
Caledonia. A matrimonial agency was set up in the
office of the Marine and Colonies. It was the rule
to send a call for the names of female prisoners
selected by governors as suitable to be sent out as
wives. As might have been expected, no great success
attended this scheme. The marriages were
never idyllic and seldom even happy. Here are a
few of the brides and their antecedents: Catherine
P., twenty-four years of age, a bad character, had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
three natural children, strangled the last with the
strings of her apron; Angelique F., hopelessly bad,
had two children, last crime, scaled the wall surrounding
the house of an aged woman of eighty,
robbed her, and on leaving, set fire to the house,
not only burning her victim to death, but causing
the destruction of three neighboring houses; Julie
Marie Robertine C., twenty, a hopeless drunkard,
stole a child and buried it alive. Nevertheless applications
were made by convicts on the eve of embarkation
to be supplied with a wife from Saint
Lazare. One wrote, “I am under sentence of eight
years for forgery and daily expect to embark for
New Caledonia. My family have cast me off, but
I am in great hopes that if they thought I was on
the way to rehabilitate myself they might be willing
to help me. The only way I can see of recovering
my position is to marry before I start for the Antipodes.
I can have no hope that any respectable
person would accept me, and I must have recourse
to some one who like myself has come within the
grip of the law. Will M. Laumonier (this letter
was addressed to the chaplain of La Grande Roquette)
put my proposal of marriage before any
inmate of Saint Lazare, who might be disposed to
accept it?” Unfortunately orders for removal
came before any matrimonial alliance could be arranged,
but it was by no means an isolated case.</p>

<p>Another letter was received by the chaplain
(l’Abb&eacute; Crozes) much to the same effect. A convict
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
sentenced to six years’ hard labor and ten years’
supervision was equally anxious to marry before his
departure, and had already made his choice, but he
appealed to the chaplain to assist him in arranging
the preliminaries. He is described as a horrible
looking ruffian, pale faced and weakly, who pretended
to be very much in love; but he would make
no admissions as to where he had met the girl who
was barely sixteen years old. The chaplain interviewed
her and found that the girl had obtained the
consent of her parents, and the convict was greatly
rejoiced. But next day a letter came from the
father directed to l’Abb&eacute; Crozes, to the effect that
his daughter had been deceived, and that he could
not consent to her marriage with a convict under
sentence of six years. The chaplain then sent for
the man to communicate this refusal. But it was
evidently no great disappointment. “You are not
upset?” he asked. “Not the least in the world,”
replied the philosophical bridegroom. As the abb&eacute;
left the prison he saw his friend sitting at the bar
of the canteen with three companions merrily employed
on a substantial repast.</p>

<p>One more story of a proposed convict marriage.
A cunning plot underlay this. The convict’s scheme
was that when taken to the church and afterwards
to the mayor’s office, he proposed to escape. His
intention was to call a halt at a wine-shop and ply
his escort, two police inspectors, with drink, and
when he had succeeded in making them drunk to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
get away. But his escort shrewdly penetrated the
design, which failed entirely, and the wedding party
ended in the return of the bridegroom to his gaol.</p>

<p>The whole question of French female criminality
centres within this prison of Saint Lazare. It is a
remarkable fact that fewer crimes are committed
by females than males in France, and the rule obtains
the world over. The proportion varies, according
to the statistics presented at the Prison
Congress in Stockholm some few years ago. It is
more than three per cent. in every hundred of both
sexes combined, in some parts of America, North
and South, in Japan and India, but it rises to ten
per cent. in the United States, to twenty per cent.
in China, and throughout Europe it ranges from
ten to twenty-one per cent., the latter being the
rule in Switzerland. The proportionate number of
women accused of crimes in France is between fourteen
and fifteen as against eighty-five and eighty-six
men. A very intelligible explanation is offered.
There are many crimes which women are not
tempted to commit, for which they miss the opportunity,
or lack facilities and strength. For example,
they are seldom convicted of peculation and embezzlement,
forgeries and robberies with violence and
resistance to authority. Their crimes are mostly
inspired by passion and greed. This last named
motive reached its climax in the case of the woman
concerned in a singularly atrocious murder, who,
when asked why she had been a party to the crime,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
coolly answered, “I wanted a new bonnet very
badly.” There is one crime, however, that specially
recommends itself to the woman criminal,&mdash;that
of poisoning,&mdash;a fact attested by criminal records
in every country and notably in France. It is
hardly necessary to quote the numerous instances
in which women of all classes have taken advantage
of facilities so freely offered to those constantly
concerned in domestic affairs. The mistress of a
house; the cook in her kitchen; the nurse by the
bedside; each of these has it in her power to administer
noxious drugs without interference and
not seldom without detection. For centuries the
crimes of the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, a Frenchwoman,
have shocked the world and rivalled the
wholesale misdeeds of Lucrezia Borgia. The mystery
of Madame Lafarge has already been referred
to in these pages. The most determined poisoner
ever known was the French woman Helene Jegardo,
who dealt death to all around her with a white
powder which was always kept by her for use in
preparing food in her kitchen.</p>

<p>As regards crime in general it is universally
agreed that a woman’s influence for evil is often
exercised over others. “<i>Cherchez la femme</i>” is
constantly quoted by French officers of justice, and
it is asserted that the woman plays a commanding
part in all associations of criminals so commonly
encountered among the Latin races. The organised
“band” is very characteristic of the criminal methods
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
in France. It is recruited from all classes and
all categories; the lowest classes, habitual thieves
and depredators, have no monopoly. There have
been bands like that of the “Habits Noir,” the
well-dressed people who ravaged Parisian society
for some time, and who were directed and assisted
by ladies in good position. This band worked very
systematically. It had its own agents and men of
business, bankers and money lenders and a whole
army of blackmailers. A long list might be drawn
up of the organisations that have flourished in
France. We need not go back to the <i>chauffeurs</i>,
the product of the general unrest after the French
Revolution, when provincial France was at the
mercy of the most active and determined gangs of
robbers. The females of these bands rendered the
most valuable assistance in seeking outlets for the
exercise of their evil practices. After them there
was the “Thiebert” band, the largest ever known,
numbering some eight hundred members and admirably
organised with an effective subdivision of
labor. Again, the “Graft” band, a corporative
society not unlike the well known firm of English
notoriety and addicted mostly to commercial frauds.
The Lemaire band was peculiar, not only in its extensive
depredations, but because it was mainly
composed of the members of two families, a curious
instance of the effect of heredity toward the criminal
bias.</p>

<p>The organised band still exists, and some of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
most baneful have flourished in modern times.
That of Vrignault and Chevalier was broken up in
1786 in a trial in which a hundred and fifty culprits
were charged. Chevalier with a certain Keippe, a
devoted friend, were the moving spirits, and they
were well served by women who had passed through
Saint Lazare. Two of the women, Piat and Conturier,
are said to have surrendered and allowed
themselves to be condemned, although really innocent,
in order that they might also be transported
to New Caledonia&mdash;an act of devotion which, according
to the director of Saint Lazare and the
Parisian police, was by no means rare. Abadie,
who subsequently suffered on the guillotine with his
confederate Gilles for murdering a woman at Montreuil,
desired to revive this method and re-organised
the broken up band of Chevalier in a systematic
fashion. He was a lad (no more) of extraordinary
intelligence and possessed the keenest criminal tendency.
It is said of him that he had been educated
on criminal fiction and studied his business in the
well-known novels of Ponson du Terrail. He had
a mania for writing, and, having been reprieved, it
was thought that he might assist in the conviction
of accused persons by becoming an official informer.
He spent his time in addressing letters to the instructing
judge, full of false confessions and unsupported
charges. In forming his band he adopted
the code established by Chevalier, which has been
preserved. It is a curious document, showing his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
logical mind and his practical methods. He formed
his society of fourteen, twelve men and two women,
and he strictly forbade any of the members to enter
into close relations with others. No one was permitted
to commit a crime without the express consent
of his chief. They were armed with revolvers,
hunting knives, loaded canes and knuckle-dusters.
They were obliged to possess a certain number of
disguises; among others, a workman’s blue blouse,
and they were ordered to work when not at their
business. They were fined if found drunk in a
wine-shop. A daily wage of six francs was accorded
to them with an additional ten francs out
of the day’s thieving. The women were to act as
spies, and to take places as servants in the neighborhood
in houses marked for plunder. Those who
joined the society were not at liberty to leave it
under pain of death. Other regulations of the same
tenor laid down strict rules of conduct, and there
is little doubt that had the society lasted it would
have added greatly to contemporary crime; but it
was broken up by the discovery of two murders
committed within the first year. Abadie had many
imitators, such as the band of the “Bois de Boulogne,”
organised by Houillon and Leclerc. In all
these it was abundantly proved that the females
were the moving spirits. They seldom acted themselves
where violence was necessary, but they advised,
indicated and encouraged the crimes. They
were obeyed readily by their confederates, who were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
afraid of them, knowing that if dissatisfied or distrustful
they would pitilessly betray any one. They
were often impelled by jealousy, that powerful incentive
in the female character which has led to
the invention by French women of that cowardly
method of obtaining revenge, the throwing of
vitriol in the face of those who offend them.</p>

<p>Of the minor crimes committed by the feminine
offender, that of theft is the most common, abundant
opportunities for practising it being afforded
them, especially in the great shops of Paris. In
many cases prevention is preferred to prosecution.
A very close supervision is exercised by private
police agents disguised as floor-walkers and salesmen,
who watch the counters and promptly lay
hands upon the light-fingered, who are haled at
once to ransom, obliged to surrender the goods or
pay for them and fined in proportion to the value
of the article stolen. It has been calculated that
out of a hundred shop-lifters taken red-handed,
quite one quarter are professional thieves, another
quarter are impelled by dire necessity, and the remaining
half are believed to be kleptomaniacs.</p>

<p>The worst side of the female criminal has now
been indicated. She is not all bad, and will exhibit
pleasanter traits. She is full of sympathetic kindliness
for the unhappy sisters she meets, and is especially
affectionate towards the small children and
the babies in arms, who are plentiful enough in this
abode of misery. The maternal instinct is strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
in Saint Lazare, and there are to be seen within its
walls many evidences of the deep natural affection
a mother has for her offspring. It is pretty to see
the pride of the most degraded when one takes
notice of her child and praises its looks. How she
bursts into jealous rage if her neighbor’s child gets
more attention! The strongest help to discipline is
exercised through the child, and a woman otherwise
incorrigible, whose evil temper no punishment can
bring into subjection, will yield abjectly and display
exemplary conduct if threatened that she shall be
separated from her child. One wretched woman
who had been sentenced to a long term bore it quite
unconcernedly until her child died, and then, in
despair, sought to take her own life. Another
woman fiercely refused to part with her dying
child. She covered it constantly with kisses, and
said more than once in heart-broken tones: “Forgive
thy mother, sweet, for having brought thee to
die in a prison.” In Saint Lazare as elsewhere, the
humanising influence of the child is greatly felt;
the prison nursery, the babies’ yard, are bright spots
of the dark picture. Everybody wants to pet them,
the wildest and most intractable creature has been
known to control herself and mend her ways by
being entrusted with the care of a child, not necessarily
her own, and even to lavish extravagant
affection upon it.</p>

<p>It has been said that Saint Lazare will shortly
be emptied and a new prison erected on more satisfactory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
lines. Much greater care will be shown in
classification, and the evils of promiscuous intercourse
will be as far as possible removed. The
wholly abandoned will no longer be able to corrupt
the youthful offender who enters prison for the first
time. At the same time, prolonged cellular confinement
will be inflicted with such judgment as to
avoid the dangers that might affect the mental balance
of easily impressionable women.</p>

<p>The stranger in Paris, who, whether impelled by
morbid fancy or the desire to pay a tribute of respect
to the illustrious dead, proposes to visit the
great cemetery of P&egrave;re la Chaise, must approach
it by the street of La Roquette. The street runs
straight from the Place de la Bastile, and through
a great portion of its length is a narrow, mournful
thoroughfare, bordered by tumble-down tenements
and small shops, devoted mostly to the sale of
white, yellow or lilac immortelles and to the preparation
of tombstones and other gloomy adjuncts of
the undertaker’s trade. But within a stone’s throw
of the gates of the cemetery, where the street widens
a little, stand two imposing edifices, face to
face, one of which is the Prison des Jeunes Detenus,
the other the Depot des Condamn&eacute;s. Both take their
names from the street of La Roquette. It was
chance, perhaps, which thus planted these criminal
resting-places upon the very threshold of death’s
domains, but there is bitter irony in it. Still more
bitter is the administrative accident, if such it be,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
which has decided the separate uses of the two establishments.
They are the Alpha and Omega of
crime. One, La Petite Roquette, as it is called,
receives the embryos, or first beginners, the little
gamins of Paris, children with inherited tendencies,
perhaps, towards vice, but who are as yet only on
its brink; the other, styled La Grande Roquette,
was long confined to the <i>haute vol&eacute;e</i> of Parisian
crime, to the old stagers in this nefarious profession,
whose misdeeds had earned for them either
lengthened imprisonment, transportation beyond
the seas, or the extreme penalty of the law, for La
Grande Roquette was “the antechamber to the
guillotine.” The first-named owes its origin to the
philanthropic desire of the authorities after the
Bourbon restoration to improve the prisons of
France, which were in deplorably bad order. The
food was insufficient and unwholesome, the inmates
when sick in the hospital slept three and four in
a bed. Especially did the prisons for juvenile offenders
need betterment. A so-called Prison Society
was created to work to that end. A first
measure was to give the young a quarter in the
various <i>maisons centrales</i>. The prisons were better
ventilated and kept cleaner; regular rations
were issued, and employment found. The moral
side alone was neglected. There was no separation,
no distinction between classes, and the young and
untainted associated freely with old and hardened
offenders. In July, 1831, lads under sixteen years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
of age were collected in a wing of St. P&eacute;lagie and
afterwards in the Magdelonettes. At the same time
the Government authorised a society for the protection
of young criminals, to place them out with
employers where they might complete their sentence.</p>

<p>A distinguished publicist, Gabriel Delessert, now
came in office as prefect of police in Paris, and was
so deeply impressed with the existing evils of the
children’s prison of La Roquette that he entirely
reconstructed it and revised its discipline. This
prison of La Roquette had been built in 1825 for
females, and had served as such until 1836, when
it was adopted as a receptacle for ill conducted and
weakly boys, broken by poverty and precocious
vice. Here they consorted with others of their
class, steadily deteriorating, so that those who entered
bad were discharged much worse, and soon
fell into fresh and more serious crime. M. Delessert
made a strenuous attempt to save them, and
decided to seek their amendment at some reformatory
establishment in which they could be kept
aloof from evil surroundings, isolated and carefully
educated by a system of useful labor and good advice
from teachers of unquestioned moral character.
The interior of La Petite Roquette was completely
transformed. Separate cells took the place of the
large associated rooms, a marked improvement was
seen in the young prisoners, both in demeanor and
conduct, with an immediate diminution in the percentage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
of reconvictions. He was greatly assisted in
these most creditable reforms by a worthy priest,
the same Abb&eacute; Crozes, chaplain of the Grand Roquette,
whose name and deeds already have been
frequently mentioned. Strict separation was the
leading principle of treatment. These children
were for the most part kept alone, living in single
cells, working in seclusion and seldom meeting their
fellows, even for exercise or play, until the Abb&eacute;
Crozes introduced the method of exercising singly,
and fenced off portions of a yard and the separation
at chapel into individual boxes, shutting off the
sight of neighbors and concentrating attention in
front.</p>

<p>This was the time when prison reformers were
crazy about preventing personal contamination, and
the r&eacute;gime as applicable to those of tender years
did not please all. M. De Metz, the founder of
Mettray, that famous agricultural colony for
French juveniles, was a magistrate of advanced
ideas, who had been sent by his Government to
examine and report upon the cellular r&eacute;gime as
recently established in the United States. He came
back satisfied that it was wholly unsuited for youthful
offenders. He much preferred the associated
life for them as it obtained in Holland and Belgium,
and he strongly advised its adoption. In 1839 he
planned a <i>soci&eacute;t&eacute; paternelle</i>,&mdash;a farm school in
fact, to receive young criminals and if possible
amend them. His motto was “the moralisation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the man by the cultivation of the soil,” and he set
himself to collect friends to put his ideas into effect.
With another philanthropist, who was a landed
proprietor, he secured and endowed the institution
known as Mettray on an estate near Tours. Good
progress was made, and in 1840 a first house was
built, in which forty juveniles were received as into
a private family, the head of which was the
“father” or master, who was always with his boys,
exercising parental control. He knew them by
heart; their character and disposition. Each family
(there are now twenty houses) is distinct, and
has no connection with any other except during
work, recreation or divine service. The houses
stand in their own ground; they are three stories,
divided into living rooms, studies and dormitories.</p>

<p>Mettray was planned on a sound basis, and attained
such excellent results that it has been made
a model for general imitation, especially in France,
where many such agricultural colonies are now to
be found, all on the family principle, with numerous
houses and extensive well-managed farms. The
results obtained at Mettray have been highly satisfactory.
Fully half of those who have passed
through it have taken to honest labor, as artisans
or in the fields. Many have entered the army and
the Government service, earning decorations and
promotion. A large percentage have married and
become respectable citizens. Some hostile critics&mdash;notably
the Russian Prince Kropotkine, who spent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
some time in various prisons&mdash;speak ill of the
Mettray system as cruel in its discipline, but general
opinion in France does not condemn it, and
admits a great debt of gratitude to M. De Metz,
in which indeed the whole world joins. Mettray
was the starting point in the movement towards
child rescue and the systematic efforts for the protection
and reclamation of the juvenile with a natural
bias towards crime, so often encouraged to evil
deeds by the misfortune of birth and heredity, the
evil influence of home surroundings, or worse still
the absence of good example or moral training.</p>

<p>Juvenile depravity has unhappily long been prevalent
in France, and is strongly marked. This is
largely due to a faulty system, mistaken methods
of treatment in the various prisons and especially
in La Petite Roquette. Intercommunication between
its inmates, despite strict discipline, is easy
and frequent, and the most depraved exert a baneful
influence over the whole. Most youthful crimes
have originated in La Roquette. “My parents
ought not to have sent me here” (under the law
which permits a parent to try imprisonment to
mend incorrigible children), said one lad. “They
thought to reform me; it has been altogether the
reverse.” “My first offence,” said another, “was
stealing fruit, and it brought me to La Roquette.
When one comes once, one returns often.” “The
cell does not keep us apart, and we go out far worse
than when we enter,” said still another. Hence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
the prevalence of serious juvenile crime. “A
French child,” writes an experienced magistrate,
“organises a murder as he would a pleasure party.”
One was so light-hearted on his way to commit a
great crime that an accomplice rebuked him saying,
“If you laugh too much our coup will fail.” Another,
who had already committed murder, wrote
on his cell wall: “When one’s pockets are empty
it is easy to understand why there are criminals.”</p>

<p>This prison as it now stands covers much ground
and has considerable architectural pretensions. It
consists of six wings grouped round a central building,
with which they are connected by light iron
bridges. This central building is circular and three
storied. The lowest, or basement, contains the
kitchen. The <i>parloir</i>, or place where the prisoners
see their friends, occupies the second. The chapel
is on the top floor. The wings have also three
stories, and the cells on each story open from a
central passage, lighted at the end, while the whole
interior is warmed very indifferently by stoves.
The r&eacute;gime of the prison is based upon the principle
of isolation; a system which might, if carried to
any extreme of severity, prove cruelly harsh to
prisoners of tender years. The solitude enforced
is not unbroken, however. Each boy, whatever his
age (and this varies from eight or nine to sixteen
or seventeen), works in his cell, sorting flowers for
immortelles, the staple product of the neighborhood;
polishing brass work, manufacturing and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
gilding chairs; but he is visited constantly by the
<i>contrema&icirc;tre</i> or contractor’s foreman, who teaches
and superintends; by the brigadier and wardens of
the wing, or by the Director&mdash;the governor and
chief of the establishment, who is continually going
his rounds. The present head of the boys’ prison
is a kindly and sympathetic person, who tempers
the rigors of discipline by the warm and lively interest
he takes in his flock. It is almost touching to
see how the eyes of the little waifs brighten as he
enters their cells; how one greets him with a cheery
“<i>bon jour</i>,” and another catches his hand and kisses
it. They will prattle to him of their doings or the
homes where they are probably unhappy and which
they scarcely regret. They will lament their misdeeds,
and make many promises to behave better
another time.</p>

<p>After all, they are not badly off in La Petite
Roquette. Ill-used, half-starved gutter children
have been heard to speak in high praise of a place
where they were well housed, well clothed, treated
kindly and,&mdash;strange experience for them,&mdash;where
they got something to eat every day of their
lives. The confinement within four walls, at an
age when life is full of spring and movement, is no
doubt irksome to these little Arabs of the streets;
but the Administration does its best to provide them
with certain regulation amusements. In the exercising
yards they may be seen behind the iron bars
trundling hoops; and squads of them, each standing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
alone in his own separate compartment, are exercised
in the “extension motions” by word of command&mdash;“<i>un</i>,”
“<i>deux</i>,” “<i>trois</i>,” and so forth;
words which they are obliged to repeat in a shrill
treble, with the double idea of enforcing attention
and, by tiring their voices, of removing all desire
to chatter among themselves.</p>

<p>In many respects, the establishment is a model
one; and it does, in fact, serve as such for those
who conduct juvenile reformatories in all civilised
quarters of the globe.</p>

<p>Saint Lazare, indeed, is still in use; and only in
December, 1905, after having been repeatedly condemned,
could it be said that its days were numbered.
A General Council of the Department of the
Seine at that time voted a sum for the erection of
an entirely new prison. The authorities were urged
to begin at once the demolition and ex-propriation
of the establishment. No doubt the cost of the new
site and new buildings will be sensibly assisted by
the sale of the present premises, situated in the heart
of Paris and on very valuable property.

considerations.</p>

<p>France, in building the prison of Fresnes, may
be said to have given to the world a model penitentiary.
It is the perfection of penal architecture and
structural fitness for the purpose intended. Before
proceeding to its consideration, however, let us take
up the story of La Grande Roquette and the later
annals of criminality with which it is identified.</p>

<p>Immediately opposite La Petite Roquette is the
great prison of the same name. As I have already
suggested, it is the final stage in the criminal career
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
which began in some minor offence, punished by
a few days’ detention in the boys’ prison, and here
ends at the scaffold upon the Place de la Roquette.
It is more by administrative design than definite
design that these two extremes, the criminal cradle
and the place of final doom, are thus brought into
close juxtaposition. Various sites in Paris have
been used from time to time for the dread performance
of “law’s finisher” commonly styled in
stilted legal language the “<i>executeur des hautes
œuvres</i>,” the official instrument for completing capital
punishment. He was the agent of High Justice
and might hold his head above his fellows who
feared and hated him because he was the vindicator
of the law. The office was not exactly honorable,
but it was lucrative, and its holder enjoyed many
privileges. He was entitled to levy taxes on food,
upon all the corn brought into the market, and on
fruit, grapes, nuts, hay, eggs and wool. He collected
a toll on all who passed the Petit Pont (the
bridge near the Ch&acirc;telet). Every leper paid him a
fee, and he acquired, by right of office, all the
clothes of which his victims died possessed. But he
carried a badge of shame, a ladder embroidered on
the breast of his coat and a ladder on the back.
His office was hereditary; son succeeded father,
and if the next in succession was of tender years
a substitute was appointed, but the rightful executioner,
sometimes no more than seven or eight,
stood by the headsman as if to sanction his proceedings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
The Sansons filled the awful post for
seven generations, nearly two hundred years. They
were for the most part in good repute and highly
esteemed by their royal masters. Louis XI indeed
made a chosen companion of his executioner,
Tristan L’Hamitte, whom he ennobled.</p>

<p>The ceremony of inflicting death was performed
anywhere in early days, often from choice in the
theatre of the crime. For a century or more the
Place de la Gr&egrave;ve was the favored spot, and was
used until the revolution of 1830, but the scaffold
was sometimes erected at the Halles (the central
markets) or the Croix du Trahoir or in almost
any wide street or square. The Barrier of Saint
Jacques was substituted for the Place de la Gr&egrave;ve
in 1832. It was a convenient distance from the
Conciergerie, in which prison the condemned found
their last resting-place. The execution was fixed
always for the afternoon, and the drive through
the crowded streets was considered a scandal, so
that a further change was decreed.</p>

<p>The prison of La Grande Roquette had spare
accommodation available. This place had been in
existence some years under the name of Little
Bic&ecirc;tre, and had been used as a <i>d&eacute;p&ocirc;t des condamn&eacute;s</i>,
in which were lodged all sentenced to
<i>travaux forc&eacute;s</i> while awaiting further removal to
the seaport <i>bagnes</i> or the great central prisons.
The concentration of so many desperate characters
under one roof led them to feel their strength and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
measure it against authority in a serious outbreak
in 1886, in which the Director would have lost his
life, but for the courageous intervention of a veteran
chief warder. From that time forth the worst
criminals were no longer sent to La Grande Roquette,
but retained in the central prisons after sentence,
from which when condemned to transportation
they were collected by agents and taken on to
St. Martin de R&eacute; to take ship for the Antipodes.
The <i>bagnes</i> were abolished some time before those
of Brest and Rochefort in 1850, and Toulon in
1872.</p>

<p>But one quarter in La Grande Roquette was especially
appropriated to convicts condemned to death,
and they proceeded after a more or less lengthy
detention direct from their cells to the guillotine.
These were in all cases the most notable murderers
only, for increasing reluctance to inflict the extreme
penalty has been exhibited in France, and successive
presidents of the Republic, from President
Gr&eacute;vy on, have constantly commuted sentences to
penal exile and spared lives that were clearly forfeited.
For the last forty years all who were actually
executed passed through La Grande Roquette,
and a brief survey of the principal malefactors and
the circumstances attending the last dread event will
be given here.</p>

<p>A few words as to the guillotine; that instrument
now invariably used for capital punishment in
France. It has played so large a part in the modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
French history that it will be interesting to
trace its origin back to the days of its godfather
and supposed inventor, a certain Doctor Guillotin,
who in the Revolutionary times was very eager to
improve the system of capital punishment, which
he desired should be uniform for all; and he had
fixed upon decapitation as the best and simplest
process. But the headsman had always been an
uncertain performer, a bungler often who could not
command his nerves, and who often slashed and
wounded his victim without dealing the death blow.
Doctor Guillotin earnestly recommended in the
Convention that every criminal should be decapitated
by means of some mechanical contrivance.
This passed into law, but before the contrivance
had been settled upon, Guillotin, at his wits’ end,
applied to Charles Sanson, at that time the official
executioner, for guidance. In their joint researches,
they came upon an old Italian wood cut giving a
presentment of the “mannaia,” an ancient machine
much used in Genoa and particularly for the execution
of Guistranin and other conspirators. The
picture might have served also for the Halifax
“Maiden” of which more directly. In both, the
axe was suspended between two uprights, the culprit
knelt beneath it, and the executioner held the
rope. It was also found that a French Marshal,
De Montmorency, had been beheaded in 1631 by
means of a sliding axe.</p>

<p>Difficulties of detail remained; chiefly, that of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
retaining the person about to suffer in the proper
position long enough for the descending blow to
take fatal effect. Then a friend, one Schmidt, a
manufacturer of musical instruments, brought Sanson
a rough sketch which met all objections and
was in fact the model for the real machine. It seems
very closely to have followed the lines of the Halifax
“Maiden.” It was immediately accepted by
the Convention, not without laughter. Dr. Guillotin
in describing his machine made use of some
strange expressions. He assured his audience that
with it he “could drop off their heads in a twinkling,
and they would not suffer in the very least.”
The only sensation might be that of a “slight freshness
about the neck.” Before closing finally, the
Assembly desired other opinions and applied, among
others, to a Doctor Louis who was at that time
physician to Louis XVI, still seated upon his tottering
throne. The following curious incident is
touched upon in the Sanson “Memoirs.”</p>

<p>While discussing the model, Doctor Guillotin and
the executioner paid a visit one day to Doctor Louis.
A stranger came into the room, who seemed greatly
impressed with the invention, but disapproved of
the shape of the axe, which was that of a crescent.
He did not believe it would act properly upon all
kinds of necks; “not on mine for instance,” said
the objector, taking up pen and ink, and drawing
an oblique edge instead of the half moon. Sanson,
the expert, was consulted, and gave it as his opinion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
that the question should be tested by actual experience.
When the machine was completed, it was
taken to Bic&ecirc;tre and set up for trial on three corpses
in the presence of a numerous company, including
that of a number of prisoners, who looked out from
the windows above. The oblique knife edge was
found to be by far the more effective, and that model
was adopted for all time.</p>

<p>The most curious part of the story is, that the
stranger who suggested the improvement in the axe
was King Louis XVI, himself, a skilled locksmith
and mechanic, having learned a trade after the manner
of all royal children. His own neck within a
few months’ time was to be subjected to the supreme
test, which succeeded perfectly. I have no wish to
deprive Doctor Guillotin of any credit that may
attach to this invention, of questionable utility, except
in simplifying the act of killing and minimising
the pain inflicted upon the victim; but he was certainly
not the first inventor of the manslaying apparatus
with which his name is for ever associated.</p>

<p>Two centuries before the Revolution, an instrument
very similar to the guillotine was in use
in Scotland, and known there as the “Maiden.”
James Douglas, Earl of Morton, died by it in Edinburgh
in 1587, thus adding to the long list of inventors
who paid the penalty of death by their own
contrivance. The “Maiden” had been often used
in Yorkshire for the summary execution of thieves
taken in the act, and the best account of it extant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
is found in “Holinshed’s Chronicles,” which describes
the custom prevailing in Halifax and the
machine in use. He records the law or custom, that
whosoever commits a felony or steals to the value
of fourteen pence or halfpenny shall be beheaded
in the market. “The engine wherewith the execution
is done is a square block of wood which does
ride up and down in a slot between two pieces of
timber that are framed and set upright, of five yards
in height. In the nether end of the sliding block
is an axe keyed or fastened with an iron into the
wood, which being drawn up to the top of the frame
is there fastened by a wooden pin, to the centre of
which a long rope is attached, that cometh down
among the people, so that when an offender hath
made his confession and hath laid his head over
the nethernmost block, every man seizeth the rope
to show his willingness that judgment should be
executed, and pulling out the pin the axe is released
to fall with such violence that had the neck below
been that of a bull the head would be dissevered
and roll away to a great distance.” If the theft
had been that of any fourfooted beast the rope was
to be fastened to it, so that when driven away it
would extract the pin.</p>

<p>France was then anxious to make a change in
the method of carrying out execution, if indeed
capital punishment were to continue in force. But
there is now a strong tendency to abolish it altogether,
as is the rule already in Italy and Belgium,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
the substitute in both countries being prolonged
solitary confinement, which is really synonymous
with a death sentence of a lingering and painful
kind. The life spared on the scaffold must be passed
in solitary confinement with the inevitable fatal consequences
of such treatment. I shall never forget
the painful impression made upon me when I came
across some seventy or eighty murderers collected
in one apartment in the prison of Ghent, all of whom
had spent ten years or more in the cells of another
prison, that of Louvain. They were all either senile
idiots or imbeciles prematurely aged. They
had been kept alive in deference to ultra-humanitarian
sentiment, but at the price of something
worse than death. It does not seem probable that
the death penalty will disappear from the French
criminal code, but a strong feeling prevails that
better arrangements should be made for carrying
out the sentence. Many are strongly in favor of
adopting the British practice of performing the execution
in private, within the limits of the gaol, that
is to say, and in the presence of only a few officials.
The selection of these last presents some difficulty,
although it has been overcome in England, and
is after all no more than the justifiable demand on
public servants to perform their duty, however trying.
One suggestion has been, to make it incumbent
upon the jury that convicted to be present;
but the fear of grave consequences has put this
aside. It has been thought, not without reason, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
juries would hesitate to find a verdict of guilty if
they were to be compelled to witness the dread consequences
of their judgment. The desire for private
execution has been emphasised in France by
a scandalous incident that occurred at Dunkirk
towards the end of 1905. A double murder of the
most cruel and dastardly character had been committed,
resulting in a double execution. A great
mob had assembled, and, under the influence of
strong excitement, stormed the scaffold when the
second head fell, determined to carry off the decapitated
corpses. The police were powerless to prevent
the outrage. An extraordinary and probably
unparalleled incident occurred at this execution.
The victim had been a woman, and the widowed
husband, thirsting to avenge her, had offered the
authorities the sum of 10,000 francs, to be paid to
the funds of any public charity, if they would allow
him to act as executioner,&mdash;to the extent at least
of touching the spring by which the knife of the
guillotine was released. The strange request was
refused; but as a particular favor a special place
in the first row of spectators was secured for the
aggrieved husband.</p>

<p>The prison of La Grande Roquette, when I visited
it, struck me painfully from its gloomy and imposing
architecture; and the effect was heightened
as I passed into the inner yards, where behind a tall
iron railing the bulk of the prison population were
at exercise. As they patrolled it in couples, backwards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
and forwards, their wooden sabots made a
hideous clatter on the stone pavement, which did
not, however, drown the hum of their voices as they
gossiped idly with one another, smoking their pipes
in pleasant company. They were a rough, evil-visaged
lot, for this was at a date anterior to the
disturbance of 1886, before mentioned, and they
were mostly habitual criminals (<i>r&eacute;cidivistes</i>), who
had been convicted again and again. They could
only be ruled by a strong hand, and the director,
M. Beauquesnes, a resolute and determined man,
had been specially selected for this responsible post.
Before his time murderous assaults by prisoners
upon their officers were common enough. Many
trades are carried on in the prison, and desperate
ruffians bent on mischief always found tools and
dangerous weapons of offence ready to their hand.
Outrages of this kind are now unknown. “How
did you get the better of them?” I asked M. Beauquesnes,
almost anticipating his answer as I met
his clear gray eyes. “By constant surveillance, by
being always on the lookout for mischief, and crushing
it before it could make head.” “Your warders
are all armed, of course?” “Not in the least. It
is better to depend upon moral than physical force.”
It did not seem to me fair or safe to leave officers
entirely defenceless among so many desperate and
easily excited prisoners without even the protection
of a baton or club, and the evil result was presently
seen in the outbreak already mentioned.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>From the yard I passed into the workshops,&mdash;long,
low, dark rooms in which gas is never lighted,
for labor begins and ends with daylight. The trades
followed were of the prison class, such as shoemaking,
tailoring and so forth. Industry and orderliness
were generally observable, but I seemed
to detect a certain unsettled air. The prisoners
gazed furtively from under their peaked caps at
a strange visitor and seemed continually on the
lookout for something to happen. They were in
fact constantly expecting the order to “move on,”
and any day the van might arrive to take them elsewhere.
It might be to the other end of the world.</p>

<p>This kind of removal, still known at La Grande
Roquette, is horrible, because it is final and irretrievable,
and the journey is to that unknown bourne
from which no traveller returns. The French system
of dealing with condemned prisoners cannot
be commended. It is cruel in the extreme, from the
long uncertainty in which the individual is left as
to his ultimate fate. He has made his last petition,
the final appeal from the legal tribunal to the possibly
more merciful Chief of the State, and he
awaits the decision for weeks and weeks in the
condemned cell. The delay is sometimes horribly
prolonged. One man waited forty days, and was
a prey the whole time to painful visions at night.
He dreamed of the guillotine and saw his head rolling
in the sawdust. He awoke with screams of
terror and cried out perpetually, “The knife! The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
scaffold! I see nothing else!” The agony of the
delay is intensified from the well-known fact that
the d&eacute;nouement, when it comes, will be abrupt and
with the briefest possible notice. Only on the very
morning of execution is the prisoner roused, generally
from profound slumber, and warned suddenly
to prepare for immediate death. All this
time, since his sentence and reception at La Roquette,
he has occupied the condemned cell, one of
three rather large chambers near the hospital at
the back of the prison. He has never been left for
one instant unattended. Two warders have been
with him, and have watched him closely day and
night. Time was when, to render assurance doubly
sure, the convict was kept continually in a strait-jacket
or <i>camisole de force</i>. The priest of the
prison has also been his constant companion. From
the condemned cell the prisoner is taken by a rather
long and circuitous route to the outer office, near
the inner gate of the prison. Here the executioner
and his assistants receive him and commence the
“toilette of death.” The man is pinioned and
bound by a variety of intricate straps. Thence,
when he is ready, the procession passes across the
courtyard to the outer prison gates. It is but a
step. Once through them, the scaffold is immediately
reached, the last act commences, is soon
played, and the curtain promptly falls. Barely
fourteen seconds elapse, it is said, from the time
the convict steps on the scaffold to the moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
when decapitation is effected. There is but a short
fruition, therefore, for the sightseers whom morbid
curiosity has attracted to the spot, even if they see
anything at all, which is doubtful, as the guillotine
is placed on the ground level, and is surrounded by
a double line of mounted gensdarmes.</p>

<p>On the very night that the guillotine was being
erected in the Place de la Roquette for the execution
of the poisoner La Pommerais, a marvellous
escape was effected by a child prisoner from the
reformatory prison opposite, the little Roquette.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock in the evening a lad of barely
thirteen years, by using his knife, cut away the
metal covering of his window in which the ventilator
worked, then climbing up on a chair placed
on top of his bed he got his head through, and
looked down into the courtyard; it was quite
empty, the night was dark; the only sound within
was the monotonous footstep of the night watchman.
But beyond the wall, there was a movement
as of a crowd collecting, and from time to time
the sound of a hammer and other tools. The boy
knew what was on foot, for the story of La Pommerais
and his approaching execution was known
within the reformatory, and it was also known that
the dread event was fixed for next morning.
“Everybody is busy,” said the fugitive, “no one
will think of me.” So he worked his little body
through the ventilator, and reached the cornice
between the first and second floor. Resting his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
feet on this narrow ledge and holding to his window
by one hand, he stretched the other towards the
next window and caught it, creeping thus from
window to window till he had passed six of them.
He was every moment in the utmost danger, for
he hung on merely by his fingers and the soles of
his heavy shoes. He said long afterwards that he
suffered agonies in the hour occupied in thus creeping
along. A single slip would certainly have precipitated
him into the yard below. He was almost
at the end of his strength, his arms ached horribly,
and his hands were torn and bleeding. He took
courage, however, saying to himself: “If I fall
I shall be killed, if I stop I shall be recaptured;
I must certainly go on.”</p>

<p>Now the moon came through the clouds, and he
knew that his shadow would be seen from below.
At that moment he heard his name called, “Molutor,
Molutor,” and he shivered, feeling sure he
had been detected. But the voice was that of a fellow-prisoner,
the occupant of the cell, the window
of which he was passing, who had recognised him.
But with true loyalty to his class he did not betray
him. On the contrary he tried to help him, and
after reconnoitring around encouraged him by saying
there were no warders in sight. Stimulated
by these encouraging words, the lad, who had already
reached the fifth window, made a renewed
effort, and passed on to the sixth, next the angle
of the building, and there seized the water pipe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
At this moment the clock struck midnight. Then
followed strange noises. Looking down, he saw
beneath him the open space of the Place de la Roquette,
in which a crowd was slowly gathering,
and some workmen were moving forward an oddly
shaped machine, which he easily recognised. They
were about to erect the scaffold. The machinery
for the guillotine and its purpose were perfectly
well known to the fugitive. At this moment it is
said he shuddered, not so much at the pressing
danger of his situation, and the near certainty of
death if he slipped, but with inward despair at the
life that lay before him. Surely it was useless to
compass his escape, to risk so much to get away
now, if some little time ahead he would inevitably
arrive at the guillotine, led step by step, passing
from court to court and judgment to judgment,
until he mounted this same scaffold, and expiated
his offences as this same La Pommerais was about
to do. Not the less did he complete his escape.
He slipped down to the ground on the other side,
gained the outer wall, and climbed it. Then he
waited until the square was thronged to get away.
When the crowd was seized with horror at the
sound of the falling knife and the thud of the severed
head in the basket he would escape. At the
supreme moment, when a shiver of horror affected
the spectators, he alone kept his head, and, with
sure, cautious step, slipped in amongst the people
and passed unchecked to the boulevard Voltaire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>A criminal drama which horrified all Paris in
1857 and had its suitable d&eacute;nouement on the Place
de la Roquette, was the murder of the Archbishop
of Paris, Monseigneur Sibour, a dignified ecclesiastic,
who was universally loved and esteemed in
his diocese. The Archbishop was on his way to
put on his vestments for the mass in the church
of St. Etienne du Mont. The procession was on
the point of entering the sacristy when a man,
dressed in black, rushed in behind the Archbishop,
who was carrying aloft the Episcopal Cross, and
with his left hand caught hold of him and twisted
him sharply round, while with his right he struck
him in the ribs with a knife. The wound was
mortal, and the Archbishop almost immediately fell
dead, while his murderer was seized and roughly
handled by the indignant crowd. The police proceeded
at once to interrogate him and soon learned
who he was. In appearance short and thin, with
a not unpleasing countenance, carefully dressed in
black, he proved to be one Louis Verger, an unfrocked
priest. He confessed that the murder was
premeditated, and that he had come to the church
with the set intention of committing it. He had
no animus against the Archbishop, but desired to
aim a blow at the dogma of the Immaculate Conception.
Thence his outcry when he struck the
fatal blow, “No more goddesses!” “Down with
the goddesses!” He was quite calm and self-possessed
afterward, and the suggestion that he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
insane quite fell to the ground. When he was received
at Mazas his mental condition was inquired
into, but there was no symptom of derangement.
His first demand was for food, for he had eaten
nothing that morning, fearing to interfere with the
steadiness of his nerves. When questioned as to
the motives of his crime, his answers were clear
and logical, except that he was fanatically hostile
to certain doctrines, and especially to that of the
celibacy of the clergy. In his parish he was constantly
at difference with his parishioners, with
whom he had many quarrels, and he was at length
removed to another parish. He went to London
to work under Cardinal Wiseman, the new Archbishop
of Westminster, and on his return to Paris
obtained fresh preferment at Saint Germain L’Auxerrois.
He was still turbulent and constantly a
thorn in the side of the Archbishop. His state of
mind was held to be doubtful, but the doctors declared
him more dangerous than mad. He preached
the most violent diatribes against ecclesiastical authority,
and richly deserved the sentence of suspension
that was decreed against him within a week
of his murderous attack upon the Archbishop.</p>

<p>No doubt excessive vanity and the desire to pose
as a public character were strong temptations to
the crime he committed. He was always greatly
pleased when people came to see him and he gloried
in his crime as a new <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> which long
would be the talk of the town. He maintained this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
attitude all through his trial, and at times behaved
scandalously by insulting the judge and ridiculing
the procedure. The audience was furiously incensed
with him, and more than once it was necessary
to suspend the proceedings. Public feeling
was entirely on the side of the murdered Archbishop.
At the same time there can be very little
doubt that he was an irresponsible being, a maniac
suffering from exaltation, eager always to “show
off;” and it would have been a bitter disappointment
to him if he had been put away in an asylum.</p>

<p>His conviction came as a matter of course, but
he did not accept it without protest, exclaiming
contemptuously, “What justice! What justice!”
He cried out that he would appeal to the Emperor
(Napoleon III), and he assured his father, when
the old man visited him, that he would not abide
by the sentence. Nevertheless he was removed
from the Conciergerie to La Roquette, and here
in his last abode he tried to play the hero, and with
much satisfaction frequently repeated the details
of his crime. He denied that he felt any remorse
for having struck down “<i>ce pauvre Monseigneur</i>,”
but was not glad that he had done it. “My work
was over,” he would say, “and I dropped my arms
to my side like the workman who has finished his
task.” The appeal made for reprieve was very ably
maintained by his advocate, but was quite fruitless.
There could be no doubt as to his guilt, and no
pity for the criminal in the Emperor. Again and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
again the condemned man prayed to be permitted
to write to the head of the state, and was very
indignant when the privilege was denied him. Still
he had access to friends outside, and hoped for
some reversal of sentence through their good offices.
He could hardly believe his ears when they
came to him on the morning of execution to make
the last dread announcement, which was conveyed
by the Abb&eacute; Hugon, who was acting as <i>aumonier</i>,
and who was accompanied as usual by the Chief
of the Police, the director of the prison and other
officials. “It is useless,” he repeated, “I know
you all; you are not speaking the truth and have
only come to see what effect the bad news would
have on me. I do not, I cannot believe it. I know
the Emperor, and feel sure he will not abandon
me.”</p>

<p>At last the dread reality forced itself on him,
and his demeanor completely changed. His air of
nonchalant bravado suddenly disappeared, and a
fierce passion for self-preservation seized him. He
grew livid with fury, and with a wild gesture of
repulsion he waved them away. “Be off, I want
no priests, no relics, no cross,” he cried. “Do not
think that I will go quietly to the scaffold. I’ll have
no scaffold. You will have to carry me there in
pieces,” and he set himself to resist vigorously,
clinging to his bed, rolling himself in his blankets,
struggling with the warders, shouting, roaring,
swearing and blaspheming. Then the director of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
La Petite Roquette thought of calling in the executioner,
although by law he is not permitted to
enter the condemned cell. M. Heinderich came
when summoned, an embodiment of superior force,
a perfect Colossus, six feet in height, with broad
shoulders, clear-eyed and full of resolution, the
picture of a self-reliant veteran. “Come, Verger,”
he said quietly, “you will not come of your own
accord? we must take you then by force!” The
prisoner was conquered, and without more ado
allowed himself to be secured. Then he was led
like a lamb to the outer office where his “toilette
of death” was quickly performed. At length he
broke down, and cried with bitter tears, “How
terrible it is to die without relations or friends.”
He listened with gratitude to the consoling words
of the priest, confessed, received absolution, and
almost immediately was a dead man.</p>

<p>A notability of the guillotine was Avinain, executed
in 1867 for a series of murders, all having
similar features. Several corpses were picked up,
all of which had been very carefully dismembered
by some hand practised in dissection. In all, the
head and limbs had been skilfully removed from
the trunk; but death had first been inflicted by
strangulation or many terrible wounds. The remains
had generally been found in the neighborhood
of the Seine, and suspicion at length attached
to a certain Jean Charles, otherwise Charles Alfonse,
who had lived in four different houses on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
the riverside. The police now discovered that there
were stables and sheds forming part of these several
dwellings. In one building they picked up a
saw, a hammer and an axe, which evidently had
been used for the purpose of dismembering the
bodies. These, according to French custom, had
been exhibited at the Morgue, and one of the articles
was recognised by a young man as having
belonged to his father, who had recently disappeared.
The deceased was a forage merchant.
He had come to Paris to sell a cartload of hay,
and had met Charles, with whom he agreed on a
price. The purchaser very civilly offered him the
accommodation of his stables for the night and a
bed at his house, so that the purchase might be
completed next morning. It appeared in the trial
that before this another person had sold forage
and had accepted hospitality for the night, but
when the host came, insisting that the light should
be extinguished for fear of setting fire to the barn,
he carried in his hand a hammer; and the guest,
a little suspicious, declared that he always slept
with a light burning, and in a very significant fashion
took out his knife as though to use it in self-defence.
There was little doubt that this man with
the hammer was the same Charles already indicated,
and the police proceeded to inquire into his
identity. He proved to be one Charles Avinain,
a butcher by trade, who had recently been a convict
in Cayenne. Since his return from transportation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
he had frequently been in trouble, and was now
easily traced and arrested by means of clues furnished
by his wife and daughter. He still lived
at the riverside, and nearly made his escape from
the police by means of a trap door in the floor of
the basement which opened on to a passage. Several
murders were brought home to him, committed
either with hammer or knife. His victims were
mostly forage merchants, and he had dealt with the
bodies in the same barbarous fashion. It is recorded
of him that he never exhibited the slightest
remorse, until the very last moment, and then
it was under the influence of overwhelming terror
as he trod the steps of the scaffold. He had always
repulsed the chaplain, but in the end accepted
his ministrations, confessed, and received absolution.</p>

<p>Moreux, who had murdered a girl to rob her
and give a present to his beloved, put down his pipe
quietly, when he received the news, saying, “I did
not think it would be before next Wednesday,” ascended
the scaffold quickly, and remarked to the
chief warder in bidding him good-bye, “You see
what comes of evil behavior.” Toly, who tried to
kill a warder when first locked up, took his sentence
very calmly, and faced death with great self-possession.
He spent his last night at cards, but received
the chaplain with great emotion and deep
sentiments of repentance. Coutalier had murdered
his wife with one blow of a hatchet, and bore up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
well until he saw the guillotine, when he threw himself
back violently, but soon regained his impassiveness.
Many were at great pains to proclaim their
innocence. It was so with Boudas, an ex-priest,
whose consuming desire was to become rich. He
poisoned two wives in succession, so as to secure
their inheritances. It was clearly proved against
him, but he reiterated as he knelt and laid his head
on the block: “Let every one know that I am not
guilty.” Gervais sacrificed an aged companion, a
well-to-do dealer in antiques, because he wanted
means to marry. His awakening on the last morning
was a frightful scene. “I can’t, I won’t believe
it. It is impossible. The law is about to commit
a terrible crime.” He fought the executioner
so hard that he had to be led twice to the block.
But he died smiling with that curious, artificial
grin that relaxes the muscles of the face at moments
of great nervous derangement, and has no
connection with real laughter. Billoir hated his
wife for her extravagance and slovenliness, murdered
her, and threw the body into the Seine. He
was an old soldier of good character and distinguished
service, but Marshal MacMahon, the President,
positively refused to pardon him. He was
quite overwhelmed with the shock when told the
fatal news, but speedily recovered himself, and,
crossing his hands on his breast, respectfully saluted
the chaplain.</p>

<p>Welker, one of the worst and most inhuman of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
his class, who had murdered a pretty child of eight,
showed the most abject cowardice. It was necessary
to carry him bodily to the scaffold, and place
him in position under the knife. A corpse was
really guillotined, for he was already dead with
fright, and had pardon come at the eleventh hour
it could not have benefitted him. Menesclon has
left a name more execrable than Welker, for his
victim was an infant of four, whom he was believed
to hold in strong affection, lavishing gifts
upon her constantly. One day she went into his
room, and the child was never seen again. After
many denials that he knew anything about her, a
neighbor was drawn to his room by the nauseating
smell of burning flesh, and on forcing his door he
was found stirring up a blazing fire in his stove.
Menesclon was barely saved from the fury of the
people when the story became known. He was
interrogated, and gave his own account of the affair.
He had invited the child into his room to give her
some flowers. But she irritated him by crying, and,
being unable to quiet her, he suddenly seized her
by the throat and choked her. When she was dead
he thrust the body between his two mattresses, and
slept the whole night through. Early next morning
he set himself to get rid of the horrible evidence
of his crime in the manner already described. This
miserable creature was one of the lowest type of
his class. He had been graduated in the lowest
schools of vice, beginning as a child at La Petite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Roquette, to which he had been committed at the
instance of his parents as perfectly unmanageable
at home. He passed thence into the navy, after
having been the despair of many workshops in
which he had been employed, at last having assaulted
and robbed his father. He had developed
into an undersized weak creature with a hideous,
pimpled face, low forehead, furtive manner and
foxy eyes. He was quite indifferent at his trial,
showed no remorse for his crime, and rarely answered
the questions put to him, which threw into
strong relief the enormity of his conduct. Service
in Senegal had left him with an incurable deafness,
which heightened his stupidity. He gazed
without flinching at the <i>pi&egrave;ces de conviction</i> lying
on the table before him. Close by was a copy-book
filled with verses, for he had poetical aspirations
and was a bit of an artist. His cold-blooded unconcern
culminated in his last answer to the question
why he had committed the crime. “I can’t
tell you,” he replied, “but you are at liberty to do
the same to me.” Menesclon exhibited the same
impassibility at the last hour. He heard his fate
with his hand to his ear, the better to catch the
words, and merely said, “<i>Ah, bon!</i>” when he
understood; and then walked quietly to the scaffold.</p>

<p>One or two later cases possessing some of the
same features may be included here,&mdash;those of
Michel Campi and of Marchandon,&mdash;which throw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
up into strong relief the insecurity of life, even in
the most crowded parts of a large city. In the
first instance a peaceable old gentleman and his
sister were murdered at three o’clock in the afternoon
in the rue du Regard, not far from the avenue
de Clichy. In the other a lady of good position
and ample means was done to death in the middle
of the night by her own man-servant, whom she
had only engaged the day before.</p>

<p>The case of Campi is as follows: On the afternoon
of a tenth of August, a man rang at the door
of an apartment in the rue du Regard where resided
Du Cros de Sixt with his sister. They were
both old people. He was well to do and secretary
to a religious society. Their residence was in a
pavilion apart from the principal building. Mlle.
du Cros answered the door in the absence of their
maid, and Campi at once struck down the old lady
with a succession of violent blows with a hammer.
Mlle. du Cros fell screaming and her brother rushing
out was treated in the same manner. Then the
miscreant, opening a large knife, cut the poor
woman’s throat and next wounded M. du Cros
mortally. Now the concierge came to the rescue,
found the two bodies lying in a pool of blood, and
hurriedly called in the police. When they arrived
they found the murderer in one of the rooms hunting
for plunder. He was forthwith arrested, and
without difficulty, although he later explained this
to the instructing judge by saying that had he not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
broken the handle of his hammer, he would have
taken other lives. Robbery was judged to be the
motive of the crime, but Campi’s advocate wished
to suggest an idea of vengeance, although no proof
of this was ever forthcoming. There was some
mystery about the man and his relations with M.
du Cros which never came out. Campi was certainly
acquainted with M. du Cros and his sister,
who survived for a couple of days. When questioned,
she begged piteously not to be forced to
reveal the secret of the man’s identity. Campi was
perfectly well known to the police as a criminal,
who had been in prison frequently, but his secret
antecedents were never brought to light. He was
said to have served in the Carlist ranks in Catalonia.
He belonged originally to Marseilles, and
his connection with the Spanish insurgents was
attested by Carlist officers who recognised him.
The mystery about him was never definitely cleared
up, and it served only to increase the interest attached
to him at the time of his trial. The account
given of his last appearance differed little from
those of other executions, but he was most anxious
to show no weakness, declined all assistance, and
cried: “I would rather walk alone. I am not in
the least afraid.” When he saw the guillotine, he
exclaimed contemptuously, “Is that all!” The
exact truth as to his identity will never be known,
but those who knew him maintained to the last
that he was not a thief; that he was essentially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
an honest man, who would not stoop to murder for
mere gain; and that some family scandal would
have been revealed if the whole story of the crime
had been laid bare.</p>

<p>In the case of Marchandon, his intention to murder
his new mistress without loss of time was
shown by the fact that he only hired for a single
day the clothes in which he presented himself in
the rue de S&egrave;ze. He had secured employment in
many houses by means of a forged certificate of
character, which was so unsatisfactory that it
roused the suspicions of the Princess Poniatowski,
who had engaged him, but would not allow him
to enter her house. She had gone at once to the
registry office to warn them, but found that Marchandon
had already been placed elsewhere, in fact,
with Madame Cornet, his future victim. He proceeded
promptly to carry out his crime. Having
secured a livery coat as already described, he waited
at table, and, after receiving his orders for next day,
he went up to bed in the garret. About one in the
morning he went down again and entered Madame
Cornet’s apartment by means of a key which he
had secured, and hid himself between the salon
and the bedroom. When Madame Cornet had undressed
and gone to bed, Marchandon attacked her.
Her piercing screams disturbed the concierge who
slept above. He got up to call the chambermaid,
believing that Madame Cornet was taken ill. The
two came down-stairs together and knocked at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
door, but received no reply. They listened at the
door for a time, and then left, thinking all must
be right, as she was moving about. It was the
murderer whom they heard, busied in getting rid of
his blood-stained clothes, and hunting for valuables.</p>

<p>The first clue to the detection of the crime was
the discovery of the hired livery coat, which was
recognised by its owner when he was found. With
it came the identification of the man-servant. He
had a snug little home of his own in Compi&egrave;gne,
where he lived with his wife very comfortably.
When arrested in the course of the day, he was just
sitting down to a little dinner of croutons and roast
fowl. The establishment was run with the means
Marchandon acquired in Paris and brought down
to his wife, the proceeds, no doubt, of his thefts.
At one time he was in the service of the well-known
M. Worth, the dressmaker of the rue de la Paix,
but always managed to get down to Compi&egrave;gne
in the evening for dinner, bringing with him fish
or fruit, or some other delicacy. He was a man of
simple tastes, very popular in his own neighborhood.
The raising of poultry was his favorite
amusement, and he delighted in growing flowers.
He was not without a certain sense of grim humor;
and a witness deposed in court to his having exclaimed,
when reading his newspaper the day after
the murder of Madame Cornet, “Why are people
so careless as to engage their servants without
proper characters!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>The two Roquettes, small and great, were much
mixed up with the painful drama of the Paris Commune.
The junior prison was for some time appropriated
to military prisoners. Paris, as the insurrection
grew, became more and more crowded
with troops, and some penal establishment was
much needed. When the Commune was in full
swing, La Petite Roquette contained about four
hundred soldiers of all branches of the service, who
in their turn gave place to the juveniles brought
back from other prisons. These, to the number
of 127, were retained until the end of May, when
they were released and sent out armed to take part
in the defence of the barricades. They soon returned
clamorous for shelter. Later, La Petite
Roquette was utilised as a place of safe custody
for all regular soldiers found in Paris who had
refused to ally themselves with the Commune.
Some twelve hundred of these more than filled the
prison.</p>

<p>A darker shadow lies upon La Grande Roquette,
for it was made the place of detention for the so-called
hostages of the Commune. Many persons
of rank and authority were arrested by the Communal
authorities as a means of imposing respect
upon the government of Versailles, now moving
its troops forward to recover Paris and re-establish
law and order. Some idea of the savage and
bloodthirsty spirit that possessed the insurgents had
already been seen in the murder of the two generals,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
Cl&eacute;ment Thomas and Lecomte, who had been
arrested and mercilessly shot at Montmartre.
Early in April it was decided to arrest Monseigneur
Darboy, Archbishop of Paris. It is said that the
same priest, Abb&eacute; Lagard, Archdeacon of St. Genevieve,
who had warned Archbishop Sibour that
Verger had threatened to take his life, now desired
to put M. Darboy on his guard. The trustful
prelate could not believe that anyone wished
him evil, but the very next day after the fight at
Ch&acirc;tillon, an order was issued to two Communist
captains to secure the persons of the Archbishop
and some of his clerics, and convey them to the
Conciergerie, where they were arraigned before
three members of the Committee of Public Safety,
Rigault, Ferr&eacute;, Dacosta. “My children,” began
the Monseigneur, “I am here to render you any
satisfaction.” “We are not your children, but
your judges,” replied Rigault. “For eighteen centuries
you and men like you have been locking up
humanity; it is now your turn.” Sentence of death
was then and there passed upon them. “These are
not men, but wild beasts,” protested the Archbishop,
who was forthwith removed with his secretary
to the depot of the Prefecture, whence they
were transferred to Mazas. The possession of
these and other hostages inspired the Communists
to open negotiations with Versailles, backed by the
threat that they would kill their prisoners unless
their terms were conceded. But indeed, this political
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
murder had been resolved upon the first moment
of their arrest, and on the morning of the
twenty-fourth of May, 1871, they were all brought
from Mazas to La Grande Roquette, where the
Governor gave a receipt for their bodies worded
as follows: “Received forty priests and magistrates.”</p>

<p>By this time the troops stationed at La Roquette
had been strongly reinforced, and on the evening
of the twenty-fifth of May another detachment
arrived. It was frankly admitted that they were
the “platoon of execution.” A list was handed
to Fran&ccedil;ois, a low creature who had been a carpenter,
containing the names of all his prisoners.
These names were called out one by one, Darboy,
the Archbishop, first. “Let me get my coat,” said
Monseigneur, but some one called out, “You will
not want it,” and taking him by the arm they led
him down to the garden that runs round the interior
of the prison. This was the first <i>chemin
de ronde</i>. The second was reached by turning to
the left, and again to the left, and was well out of
sight of the ordinary prison and the hospital. The
hostages then appear to have been arranged according
to rank from right to left. The Archbishop
first, then M. le President Bonjean, and then the
rest of the priests. Just before the final act, the
Archbishop raised his hand to bless and absolve
his companions, six in all, who faced the firing
party at thirty paces distant. At the word of command
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
the execution was completed. In those days
of massacre the guillotine was deemed too slow,
and the bullet took its place.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning the same process was
repeated with the fifteen remaining hostages, who
were led out one by one and formed up under the
same wall. Nowadays the many sympathisers with
the victims of this dastardly act, who come from
all parts of the world to visit the scene of the murder,
will find a marble tablet fixed in the wall over
the exact spot where they fell. It bears the inscription:
“Respect this place which witnessed the
death of the sainted and noble victims of the 24th
of May, 1871.” An iron balustrade keeps off irreverent
feet, and is constantly adorned with wreaths
of immortelles. A large number of hostages remained,
many of whom were gensdarmes. They
were removed from prison and massacred in a body
at Belleville.</p>

<p>After many essays at improvement the prisons
of Paris have entered upon a stage of approximate
perfection, and the capital is now possessed of a
penal establishment that compares with any in the
civilised world. The great prison of Fresnes, after
four years in building at immense outlay, was completed
and occupied in July, 1898. It is situated
on the very outskirts of Paris, replacing a number
of old-fashioned prisons. It covers a wide extent
of ground. The entrance is on the Versailles road
(on the left of the visitor coming from Berny station),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
where the great edifice with its imposing,
but not too florid, architecture, presents a view of
many lofty parallel blocks, flanked by smaller buildings
appropriated to the service of the prison.</p>

<p>Passing first the gatekeeper’s lodge, in front of
which stands the Governor’s residence of ambitious
dimensions, we enter a long avenue, well planted
with trees, and find on the left other dwellings occupied
by the superior staff, and on the right a
great block of 156 cells in three tiers. This cell
house is the <i>quartier de transf&egrave;rement</i>; in other
words, the place of passage in which are accommodated
all the classes till now found in La Grand
Roquette. Those sentenced to long terms exceeding
one year will in due course move on elsewhere
to the colonial establishment beyond the sea, or the
<i>maisons centrales</i>, the district prisons in or near
Paris. Further on is the main building, housing
close upon two thousand cells, arranged in three
grand divisions, each separate and distinct and containing
508 cells. Each affords ample provision
for the different categories of prisoners to be
lodged, <i>pr&eacute;venues</i> or those waiting trial, short term
prisoners and juveniles. The first design was to
receive females at Fresnes, but Saint Lazare is
eventually to be replaced by another especially constructed
prison for their reception. The main entrance
of this principal quarter is in the centre, with
a gatekeeper’s lodge on one side and a military
guard under an officer on the other. Beyond and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
behind them are the extensive yards and buildings
required in attending to the services of the prison,
the storehouses for food and clothing, the kitchens
and bakeries and laundries, and the plant for the
generation of electricity. All these are on the left,
while on the right is the reception ward with four
hundred cells of ample dimensions, each having a
cubical content of eighteen yards.</p>

<p>With such an extensive acreage the inconvenience
of great distances to traverse is met by
transverse tunnels and many lines of railways serving
all parts of the prison. On the prison galleries
too, there are the trams to carry the day’s rations
and necessaries from cell to cell. There are lifts
everywhere, and many staircases in the most convenient
places. The cells are all very spacious,
their decoration and fittings artistic, and in the
best modern style, with varnished walls, washing
arrangements in porcelain, and a plentiful supply
of water. The warming and ventilation are on the
best principles. The only fault to be found with
the modern plan of prison management is that
over-much attention is paid to material comfort.
The condition of the wrongdoer in durance is far
superior to his way of life when at large. He goes
back to it improved in physique, better able to
endure its hardships, and possibly fortified against
relapse.</p>

<p>Whether when he finally emerges he has benefitted
morally may be doubted. It is impossible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
with so large a population, spread over so large
an area, that there can be any reformatory process
as applied to individuals. Fresnes is open to the
serious objection that it is too large for effective
moral discipline, and that government of some
2,500 persons, four-fifths of whom are criminals
of many varied classes, would make excessive demands
upon even a heaven-born administrator and
philanthropist.</p>

<p>As we have seen in the closing paragraphs of
this volume, the great prison of Fresnes exemplifies
the best practice of modern penology in the incarceration
and discipline of those whom society, for
its own protection, isolates from itself. But punishment
is not necessarily reform; and it may be
doubted whether the redemption of the criminal
will ever be accomplished by model prison structures
alone. France, in common with all other
nations, has this further step of reformation yet
to take. But little indication of what its nature
shall be, in France or elsewhere, has been given;
for its revelation we must look to the future.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
